Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Rykard,

It was a pleasure caring for you at Lincoln Park Community Hospital.  You were admitted to the hospital because of weakness on your right side, which is concerning for a stroke.  We did an MRI of your brain and found that there was a small area of damage in the right hemisphere of your brain.  This is consistent with a stroke, but we are not sure what caused it.

We treated you with medications to prevent further strokes and 
to control your blood pressure.  Your weakness has improved, 
but you may still have some residual weakness on your right side. 

Please follow up with your neurologist as scheduled below.
 
Followup Instructions:
Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Sawyer in 1-2 weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as needed for the management of Right hemispheric stroke. Please contact our office to schedule this appointment at least 24 hours in advance.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Jensen,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at North Jordan General Hospital.  You were admitted to the 
Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) with abdominal pain, 
diarrhea and vomiting. Imaging studies showed that your bowel 
was damaged and you had an infection in your abdomen. In order to 
treat this, we made a hole in your abdomen so that gas could escape 
and we started antibiotics. You improved over the next few days 
and were transferred back to the general pediatric floor where 
you continued to improve.

You will be discharged home with the following medications: 

* Dilaudid 2mg every 3 hours for pain
* Lovenox 40 mg twice a day for 8 more doses

Please take all of your medications as prescribed. You should 
start to feel better over the next few days and you can wean off 
of the dilaudid as needed.

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up by >1lb 

You will need to follow-up with Dr. Julianne Marquez in 2 weeks for a re-evaluation of your abdominal pain and diarrhea symptoms. Please schedule this appointment as soon as possible to ensure that you receive the necessary care and attention.

Thank you again for allowing us to be a part of your healthcare 
team! We wish you all the best!

Sincerely,
Your North Jordan General Hospital Team

Dear Mr. Ryder,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization at Northbrook Community Healthcare System..  You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and found to have fluid overload in your body.  Your heart failure worsened and you required dialysis to remove excess fluid from your body.  We gave you intravenous medications to help improve your heart function, which improved your symptoms.  You also had a cardiac catheterization, which showed no significant blockage in the blood vessels supplying blood to your heart.

We are discharging you home on a daily dose of Lasix (a diuretic medication) and we recommend that you continue dialysis three times per week for the next two weeks.  We also recommend that you follow up with your cardiologist and nephrologist as scheduled below.

Please call Dr. Julianne Patel office at Northbrook Community Healthcare System. if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care!

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Blackwood,

You were admitted to the hospital after you developed a 
bleeding in your brain called an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). 
The bleeding was located on the right side of your brain, near 
the front and top part of your head. You underwent imaging with 
a CT scan, which showed that there is no more active bleeding in 
your brain. You were also seen by a neurosurgeon who determined 
that you do not need surgery to remove the blood from your brain.

During this admission, we made some changes to your medications 
to help prevent future bleeds. We stopped taking you off of 
Aspirin and started you on Metoprolol (another blood pressure 
medication). You should continue to take Aspirin 325mg daily for 
the next month and then stop taking it.

You were also found to have an abnormal heart rhythm called a 
SVT. This is likely related to the stress of your recent bleed, 
but we are not sure what caused it. We treated you with IV 
medications that helped control the SVTs. You should follow up 
with your cardiologist who will help determine why this was 
happening.

You were also found to have a low blood pressure on admission. 
We gave you IV fluids and medications that helped improve your 
blood pressures.

It is very important that you continue to take all of your 
medications as prescribed. You should follow up with your PCP 
and neurologist in the next few weeks to make sure that you are 
doing well and do not have any worsening symptoms from this 
bleed.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care,

your brain. You were also seen by a neurosurgeon who determined 
that you do not need surgery to remove the blood from your brain.

During this admission, we made some changes to your medications 
to help prevent future bleeds. We stopped taking you off of 
Aspirin and started you on Metoprolol (another blood pressure 
medication). You should continue to take Aspirin 325mg daily for 
the next month and then stop taking it.
