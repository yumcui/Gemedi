Discharge Diagnosis:
right hip fracture
 

 
Hospital Course:
You were admitted to the orthopedic surgery service after you 
had a right hip fracture. You had a ORIF of your right hip fracture 
and tolerated the procedure well. You are now ready for discharge.

Please follow up with your primary care physician and continue 
to take all medications as prescribed.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Right hip fracture

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker 
or cane).

 
Discharge Instructions:
- Please return to the emergency department or notify your 
physician if you experience any of the following: severe pain 
not relieved by medication, increased swelling, decreased 
sensation, difficulty with movement, fevers greater than 101.5, 
chills, increasing redness or drainage from the incision site, 
chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerns.

- You may shower, but no tub baths or swimming for at least 4 
weeks. Any stitches or staples that need to be removed will be 
taken out by the visiting nurse in approximately 2 weeks.

- Please DO NOT drive until cleared by your surgeon.

- You may resume your regular diet and increase your fluid and 
fiber intake as tolerated.

- We recommend that you avoid heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, 
or carrying items greater than 5 pounds for 6 weeks. This will aid 
in the healing process of your hip fracture.

- Please call your physician's office to schedule or confirm 
your follow",good,"1. Conflicting Blood Thinner Instructions: The patient is discharged on Enoxaparin Sodium, which is an anticoagulant (blood thinner) appropriate for DVT prophylaxis after hip surgery. However, the 'Discharge Instructions' section explicitly states, 'You will need to stop taking any blood thinning medication such as Plavix or Coumadin. Please discuss restarting these medications with your surgeon at your follow up visit.' This creates a dangerous contradiction. The patient might interpret 'any blood thinning medication' as including their newly prescribed Enoxaparin, potentially leading them to discontinue crucial DVT prophylaxis. If this instruction refers to pre-existing home medications, it should be clarified as such, and the interaction with the new Enoxaparin prescription should be explicitly addressed. 2. Conflicting Follow-up Instructions: The note provides conflicting guidance on follow-up. The 'Followup Instructions' sections (both instances) clearly state, 'Please schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel in 1 week...' (Dr. Patel is the attending surgeon). In contrast, the 'Hospital Course' section concludes with, 'Please follow up with your primary care physician and continue to take all medications as prescribed.' For immediate post-operative care after orthopedic surgery like a hip fracture ORIF, the primary follow-up is typically with the surgeon. These contradictory instructions can confuse the patient about who to see and when. 3. Redundant Information: Several sections of the note are repeated verbatim (Patient Demographics, Discharge Diagnosis, Followup Instructions) or with minor variations (Discharge Instructions). While not a clinical error, it makes the note unnecessarily long and poorly organized. 4. Incomplete Sentence: The last sentence in the 'Discharge Instructions' (second block) is incomplete: 'Please call your physician's office to schedule or confirm your follow'.","Name:  Astrid Jensen                  Unit No:   2136950

Followup Instructions:
Return to see Dr. Julianne Marquez in 1 week for a follow-up appointment to assess progress and adjust treatment plan as needed. If symptoms worsen or new concerns arise before then, please contact our office to schedule an urgent visit with Dr. Julianne Marquez.",good,"1. Clinical Inappropriateness of Simvastatin: Prescribing Simvastatin (a statin for hyperlipidemia) to an 11-year-old patient without any specific clinical justification (e.g., severe familial hypercholesterolemia) mentioned in the discharge instructions is highly unusual and clinically questionable for a pediatric patient. 2. Age-Inappropriate Dosing for Acetaminophen: Acetaminophen 650 mg is a standard adult dose. For an 11-year-old, acetaminophen dosing should be weight-based (typically 10-15 mg/kg per dose), and 650 mg is likely an overdose for an average child of that age. 3. Age-Inappropriate Dosing for Docusate Sodium: Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID is a common adult dose. Pediatric dosing is typically lower and weight-based. 4. Age-Inappropriate Dosing for Senna: Senna 8.6 mg PO HS is a common adult dose. Pediatric dosing is typically lower and weight-based. 5. Inconsistency in Discharge Instructions: The instruction ""We started you on metformin"" directly contradicts the subsequent instruction ""Please resume taking all of your medications as prescribed at home."" If metformin was newly started during the admission, it is a new medication, not one to be resumed. This suggests an error in the wording or an unclear medication history. 6. Lack of Clinical Context for Extensive Pediatric Regimen: For an 11-year-old admitted primarily for ""elevated blood sugar,"" the discharge medication list is extensive and includes medications for multiple unstated chronic conditions (e.g., Lisinopril for hypertension, Simvastatin for hyperlipidemia, Omeprazole for GERD, and two laxatives for constipation). The brief discharge instructions do not provide any clinical context or justification for these additional medications in a pediatric patient, making the note clinically incomplete and lacking rationale for such a complex regimen.","Name:  Kaius Blackwood                  Unit No:   2459873

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Vasquez,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay. You were admitted to the gynecology service after delivering a healthy baby girl at 39 weeks gestation with a postpartum hemorrhage secondary to placenta accreta. A cesarean section was performed and you required multiple units of blood for transfusion. You were seen by interventional radiology who placed an embolization in your uterus to stop the bleeding. Your condition has improved significantly since then.

the gynecologists listed below:

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the orthopedic service for your right distal tibia fracture. You underwent ORIF with a plate and screws, which went well. You are now ready for discharge home.

Please follow these instructions at discharge:

* Please remain nonweightbearing on your right lower extremity until you see your PCP or Ortho follow-up.
* Continue to take your pain medication as directed.
* Take all medications as prescribed by physicians at discharge.
* Do not drive while taking narcotics.
* You may resume your home medications unless otherwise instructed.

you experience any of the following:

* Increasing pain that is not controlled with pain medication
* Increasing swelling
* Decreasing sensation
* Decreasing circulation
* Pain or headache with inability to tolerate your pain

* Any other concerns

Followup Instructions:
Please return to see Dr. Julianne Marquez in 2 weeks for a follow-up appointment to assess the progress of your right distal tibia fracture and remove any sutures or staples as needed.

Acetaminophen Overdose Risk: The patient is concurrently prescribed Acetaminophen 325 mg PO Q6H PRN for 'mild pain' and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen (5mg-325mg) 1 TAB PO Q4H PRN for 'pain'. This creates a significant risk of exceeding the maximum daily dose of acetaminophen (typically 3000-4000 mg/day, often lower for elderly patients like Julian Stovall). The patient could unknowingly take acetaminophen from both prescriptions, potentially leading to acetaminophen toxicity. The discharge instructions do not provide explicit warnings about combining these medications or tracking the total daily acetaminophen intake.","Name:  Julian Stovall                  Unit No:   9551551

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Blackwood,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Northbrook Community Hospital.  You were admitted to the 
hospital after a fall with right hip dislocation and left shoulder 
dislocation. You underwent reduction of your right hip dislocation 
in the emergency department, and your left shoulder dislocation was 
reduced by orthopedics on Jones. Your pain has been managed with 
oral medications, and you have not had any fevers or increased red 
cell counts in your urine. 

Because you are having difficulty walking independently, we are 
discharging you to a rehab facility where you will receive physical 
therapy to help you regain your strength and independence. You will 
also be followed closely by the orthopedic surgeons after discharge 
from rehab.

We wish you all the best!

Sincerely,
Your Northbrook Community Hospital Team
 
Followup Instructions:
Return to see Dr. Julianne Marquez in 1 week for a follow-up appointment to assess your progress and adjust treatment as needed, or sooner if you experience any worsening of symptoms or side effects from medication. Please call our office to schedule this appointment at least 24 hours in advance. If you are unable to keep this appointment, please notify us immediately so that we can reschedule for a later date.",good,"1. Inconsistency in Discharge Disposition and Facility: The 'Discharge Disposition' is listed as 'Extended Care,' implying the patient is going to a rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility. However, the 'Facility' is listed as 'Home Health Services,' which indicates the patient is returning home with services. These are mutually exclusive. The 'Discharge Instructions' explicitly state, 'we are discharging you to a rehab facility,' confirming the 'Extended Care' disposition, making 'Home Health Services' contradictory and incorrect. 
2. Inappropriate Follow-up Instructions: Given the patient is being discharged to a 'rehab facility' for physical therapy and will be followed by orthopedic surgeons 'after discharge from rehab,' a follow-up appointment with the attending physician (Dr. Julianne Marquez, General Medicine) in 1 week is clinically illogical. While in a rehab facility, the patient's medical care is managed by the facility's medical team, and outpatient follow-ups with the admitting physician are typically scheduled once the patient is discharged from the rehab facility and returns home. 
3. Unexplained Clinical Detail: The statement in the discharge instructions, 'you have not had any fevers or increased red cell counts in your urine,' includes a specific detail about 'red cell counts in your urine' without any preceding context in the note (e.g., concern for urinary tract injury, kidney injury, or other relevant genitourinary issue). While not an error per se, its inclusion without context makes it seem out of place for a patient admitted primarily for hip and shoulder dislocations.","Name:  Kaius Blackwood               Unit No:   2551152

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Marquez,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization at Oakwood Community Hospital.  You were admitted for palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest pain.  We found that you had an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.  This is a common condition in the elderly with risk factors like high blood pressure and diabetes.

We started you on a medication called metoprolol succinate to slow your heart rate down.  Your symptoms improved significantly after starting this medication.  We also gave you some medications for nausea, vomiting, and chest pain.  You will need to follow up with your cardiologist and primary care doctor after discharge.

Please take all of your medications as prescribed.  Please stop taking the following medications: 
No changes at this time

We wish you a speedy recovery!

Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel in 1-2 weeks to assess progress and adjust treatment plan as needed, or sooner if symptoms worsen or new concerns arise.

If you experience severe side effects or have questions regarding your current treatment plan, please do not hesitate to reach out to our office for immediate assistance. We are committed to providing ongoing support and care throughout your recovery process.",good,"1. Patient Misgendering/Name Inconsistency: The salutation in the Discharge Instructions states 'Dear Mr. Marquez,' which contradicts the patient's recorded sex 'F' and name 'Julianne Marquez'. It should be 'Dear Ms. Marquez'.
2. Medication Discrepancy: The Discharge Instructions mention that 'We also gave you some medications for nausea, vomiting, and chest pain.' However, no antiemetic medications (for nausea/vomiting) or specific chest pain medications (beyond PRN Acetaminophen for general pain/fever) are listed on the Discharge Medications list. This creates ambiguity regarding whether these medications should be continued or if they were only for inpatient use and are now discontinued.
3. Missing Medication for Primary Diagnosis (Hyperlipidemia): Hyperlipidemia is listed as a primary diagnosis, but no lipid-lowering medication (e.g., a statin) is included in the Discharge Medications. This is a significant omission for a primary diagnosis that typically requires ongoing pharmacological management.
4. Missing Medication for Secondary Diagnosis (Depression): Depression is listed as a secondary diagnosis, but no antidepressant medication is prescribed on discharge.
5. Missing Medication for Secondary Diagnosis (Diabetes Mellitus Type II): Diabetes Mellitus Type II is listed as a secondary diagnosis, but no antidiabetic medication (e.g., metformin, insulin, GLP-1 agonist) is prescribed on discharge. This is a critical omission for a chronic condition that requires continuous management.
6. Missing Medication/Management for Secondary Diagnosis (Hepatitis C Cirrhosis): Hepatitis C cirrhosis is a severe chronic condition. No specific medications for managing cirrhosis complications (e.g., diuretics for ascites, lactulose for encephalopathy, Rifaximin) or for ongoing Hepatitis C treatment (DAAs) are listed on discharge.
7. Conflicting Follow-up Instructions: The Discharge Instructions state that the patient 'will need to follow up with your cardiologist and primary care doctor after discharge.' In contrast, the Followup Instructions section explicitly states to 'Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel in 1-2 weeks.' It is unclear if Dr. Julianne Patel (the attending physician) is meant to be the patient's primary care doctor or cardiologist, or if these are separate follow-ups, leading to confusion for the patient about who to follow up with and for what purpose.","Name:  Julianne Marquez                  Unit No:   1449984

Dear Mr. Ryder,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Mountainbrook Regional Hospital.  You were admitted to the hospital with chest pain, shortness of breath and nausea/vomiting.

Standard practice for patients with a coronary stent is dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (e.g., Aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor like clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel) to prevent stent thrombosis. Warfarin is an anticoagulant used for conditions like atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism, which are not listed in the discharge diagnoses. If there is an indication for warfarin, it is not stated, and the absence of a P2Y12 inhibitor is a critical omission for a post-stent patient.

However, the Discharge Medications list also includes Atorvastatin 20 mg, Clopidogrel 75 mg, and Furosemide 40 mg PO BID, which are not mentioned in the 'changes' section. This creates an inconsistency and an incomplete picture for the patient regarding their medication regimen changes. 2. Clinical Rationale for Furosemide: The discharge diagnoses are 'Coronary artery disease' and 'Hypertension'. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is typically indicated for heart failure, fluid overload, or specific cases of hypertension with edema, none of which are explicitly stated or suggested by the primary diagnoses or the brief admission reason. Without further context, its prescription lacks a clear clinical rationale in the provided note. 3. Ambiguous Follow-up Instructions: The 'Discharge Instructions' state the patient needs to follow up with 'Dr. Julianne McCormick Cardiology and Dr. Julianne McCormick Primary Care'. However, the 'Followup Instructions' only mention 'Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne McCormick in 1 week' without specifying if this is for Cardiology, Primary Care, or if two separate appointments are required, creating ambiguity for the patient. 4. Clinical Rationale for Clopidogrel: Clopidogrel is typically prescribed as part of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with coronary artery disease. While the patient was admitted for chest pain and had 'arteries narrowed in multiple places,' the note does not specify if an ACS event occurred or if a PCI was performed, which would be the primary indications for adding clopidogrel to aspirin. Without this context, the rationale for clopidogrel is incomplete.","Name:  Astrid Jensen                 Unit No:   2116677

Critical Oxycodone Dosing Error: Prescribing OxyCODONE (Immediate Release) 5 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q4H (total 10 mg per dose) for a 9-year-old pediatric patient is a severe overdose. Standard pediatric dosing for oxycodone is typically 0.05-0.15 mg/kg/dose. For an average 9-year-old (approx. 30 kg), this dose should be 1.5 mg - 4.5 mg, making 10 mg dangerously high and likely to cause respiratory depression. 3. Oxycodone Clinical Appropriateness Error: Prescribing a potent opioid like OxyCODONE for a mild head injury (CT negative for bleeding/damage, symptoms resolved with rest) is clinically inappropriate. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen would be the standard pain management. 4. Oxycodone Dispensing Quantity Error: Dispensing 100 tablets of OxyCODONE for a mild head injury and a short hospital stay is an excessive quantity, raising concerns about opioid overprescribing. 5. Acetaminophen Dosing Error: Prescribing Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (total 650 mg per dose) for a 9-year-old pediatric patient is likely an overdose.

If your symptoms worsen or you experience new concerns before then, please contact our office to schedule an urgent appointment with Dr. Sloane.",good,"1. Clinical Logic Error: The patient is discharged with two potent opioid pain medications (Oxycodone and Hydromorphone) prescribed concurrently for PRN use. Prescribing two different opioids with different dosing schedules (Q4H and Q3H) for home use is highly unusual, potentially dangerous due to increased risk of overdose, additive side effects (e.g., respiratory depression, sedation, constipation), and medication confusion. Typically, one opioid would be chosen, or strict instructions provided if alternating were intended, which is not indicated here. This represents a significant medication safety and clinical reasoning error.","Name:  Ava Morales                  Unit No:   4449987

We look forward to seeing you soon!",good,"1. Medical reasoning error: Prescribing Aspirin 325 mg PO DAILY immediately after a Right frontotemporal ICH (Intracerebral Hemorrhage) is a significant clinical error. Antiplatelet agents like aspirin are generally contraindicated or withheld for a substantial period (weeks to months) following an acute ICH due to a high risk of re-bleeding. 2. Inconsistent management for Atrial Fibrillation: While the withholding of anticoagulation immediately post-ICH is often appropriate, the patient is diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation, which typically requires long-term anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Aspirin 325 mg is not an effective or appropriate treatment for stroke prevention in AFib and is harmful in the setting of recent ICH.","Name:  Ava Morales             Unit No:   2551552

Discharge Diagnosis:
Right hip osteoarthritis

 
Hospital Course:
The patient came to the hospital with right hip pain and was found 
to have a dislocated hip.  He had an emergent reduction of his 
hip, which was successful.  Post-operatively he has been tolerating 
a regular diet and has not had any fevers or chills.  His pain has 
been controlled with oral medications.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you dislocated your hip 
on the operating room table after surgery for your right hip osteoarthritis. 
You had a procedure called an emergent closed reduction, where we 
reduced your hip under sedation and it went back into place.  You 
have been tolerating a regular diet post-operatively and have not 
had any fevers or chills.  Your pain has been controlled with oral 
medications.
.
ACTIVITY:
- Do not bear weight on your right lower extremity
- Use crutches to ambulate
- Keep your right knee bent at about 90 degrees when sitting in a 
chair or on the edge of bed
 
WOUND CARE:
- You may shower but no tub baths or swimming for at least 4 weeks
- No dressing is needed if wound continues to be non-draining
- Any stitches or staples that need to be removed will be taken out 
at your 2-week follow up appointment

MEDICATIONS:
- Resume all home medications, EXCEPT take fewer narcotics because 
you are not able to bear weight on your right lower extremity.
- You may also take your pain medication every 3-4 hours as needed 
for pain
- Do NOT drink alcohol or drive a motor vehicle while taking any 
narcotic pain medication
 
FOLLOW UP:
Please return to see Dr. Julianne Patel in 1 week for suture removal and wound check, and again in 2 weeks for re-evaluation of your hip osteoarthritis treatment plan. During this time, please contact our office if you experience any increase in pain or swelling.

 
Followup Instructions:
Return to see Dr. Julianne Patel in 4 weeks for a follow-up appointment to assess the progress of your right hip osteoarthritis treatment and make any necessary adjustments to your care plan.

If you experience any increase in pain or swelling before then, contact us immediately so that we can provide further guidance and support. Thank you for entrusting Dr. Julianne Patel with your orthopedic care!",good,"1. Inconsistent Event Description: The 'Hospital Course' states the patient 'came to the hospital with right hip pain and was found to have a dislocated hip' and 'had an emergent reduction.' However, the 'Discharge Instructions' state, 'You were admitted to the hospital because you dislocated your hip on the operating room table after surgery for your right hip osteoarthritis.' These are two distinct and conflicting scenarios for the acute event leading to admission and intervention.
2. Contradiction Regarding Surgical Incision/Wound: The note explicitly mentions 'emergent reduction' and 'emergent closed reduction,' which typically implies a non-invasive procedure without an incision. However, the 'WOUND CARE' and 'FOLLOW UP' sections refer to 'stitches or staples that need to be removed' and 'suture removal and wound check,' which are only applicable after an open surgical procedure or if a prior surgery (not mentioned as the reason for admission) had occurred.
3. Illogical Medication Instruction: The instruction 'Resume all home medications, EXCEPT take fewer narcotics because you are not able to bear weight on your right lower extremity' is medically unsound. An inability to bear weight generally indicates a significant injury or surgical recovery phase that often requires adequate pain management, potentially including narcotics. The rationale provided for taking 'fewer narcotics' is contradictory to the severity implied by non-weight-bearing status.
4. Conflicting Medication Dosing Instructions: The 'Discharge Medications' specify OxyCODONE 5 mg PO Q4H:PRN Pain - Moderate. However, the 'MEDICATIONS' section in the discharge instructions states, 'You may also take your pain medication every 3-4 hours as needed for pain.' This creates ambiguity regarding the permissible dosing interval (every 4 hours versus every 3-4 hours).
5. Redundant and Conflicting Follow-Up Instructions: The note contains two separate sections for follow-up. The first 'FOLLOW UP' section specifies appointments in '1 week for suture removal and wound check, and again in 2 weeks for re-evaluation of your hip osteoarthritis treatment plan.' The separate 'Followup Instructions' section states, 'Return to see Dr. Julianne Patel in 4 weeks for a follow-up appointment to assess the progress of your right hip osteoarthritis treatment.' This creates confusion regarding the number, timing, and specific purposes of the post-discharge follow-up appointments.
6. Incomplete Discharge Diagnosis: While 'Right hip osteoarthritis' is a chronic condition, the 'Hospital Course' describes an acute event of a 'dislocated hip' and 'emergent reduction.' The discharge diagnosis should reflect the acute condition and procedure that necessitated hospitalization, not solely the underlying chronic condition, especially when it was the primary reason for the emergent intervention.","Name:  Matthew Brown                Unit No:   2166674

Clinical Inconsistency: The discharge diagnosis of 'Right knee osteoarthritis' is inconsistent with multiple discharge instructions that clearly indicate a recent surgical procedure or acute intervention. The Physical Therapy section instructs the patient to bear weight with a 'brace in place' and to keep a 'splint/dressing clean and dry'. More critically, the Wound Care section explicitly mentions an 'incision' and 'drainage from incision'. Osteoarthritis alone does not involve an incision, splint, dressing, or specific post-operative weight-bearing instructions with a brace. This suggests a missing or incomplete primary discharge diagnosis, such as 'Status post Right Total Knee Arthroplasty' or a similar surgical procedure performed for the osteoarthritis.","Name:  Karen Brown                   Unit No:   2451151

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Jensen,

You were admitted to the hospital after you experienced a stroke. You 
were found to have a blood clot in your brain which was causing some 
of the damage seen on imaging. The neurology team felt that this 
stroke was most likely due to a combination of factors including 
your high cholesterol, diabetes and smoking history.

You were treated with medications to thin out your blood (Plavix) 
and to prevent you from having another stroke. You will continue 
to take these medications at home as well as your other 
medications for high cholesterol and blood pressure control.

The physical therapists worked with you while you were in the 
hospital and felt that you had made sufficient progress so that 
you are safe to go home. They recommended that you wear compression 
stockings on your legs when walking or standing for long periods 
of time. The occupational therapists also worked with you and 
felt that you have the skills necessary to take care of yourself at 
home.

The neurologists felt that it is safe for you to return home as well 
and that you do not need further inpatient rehabilitation at this 
time. They recommended that you follow up with your primary care 
physician within the next week and schedule an appointment with a 
neurologist in two weeks for re-evaluation of your stroke.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your Ramirez Medical Center Team
 
Followup Instructions:
Please return to see Dr. Julianne Marquez in 2 weeks for a follow-up appointment to assess progress and adjust treatment plan as needed. During this time, please continue to take all medications as prescribed and report any changes in symptoms or condition to the office immediately. If you experience a worsening of symptoms or have concerns before your scheduled follow-up, contact Dr. Julianne Marquez's office for urgent attention.",good,"1. Medication Discrepancy (Anticoagulant/Antiplatelet): The discharge instructions state the patient was treated with and should continue 'Plavix' (clopidogrel) to thin the blood, but Plavix is not listed on the discharge medication list. Instead, Warfarin and high-dose Aspirin (325 mg) are prescribed. Prescribing both high-dose Aspirin and Warfarin concurrently significantly increases bleeding risk, especially after a stroke, and is generally not recommended for routine secondary stroke prevention without specific and compelling indications not detailed in this note. 
2. Medication Discrepancy (Diabetes): The discharge instructions identify 'diabetes' as a contributing factor to the patient's stroke, yet no antidiabetic medications (e.g., metformin, insulin) are listed among the discharge medications. This is a significant omission if the patient truly has diabetes. 
3. Medication Duplication (Beta-blockers): Both Metoprolol Succinate XL (long-acting) and Metoprolol Tartrate (immediate-release) are prescribed. Typically, only one form of metoprolol or a single beta-blocker would be prescribed. 
4. Medication Duplication (Statins): Both Simvastatin and Atorvastatin are prescribed. Patients are typically prescribed only one statin. 
5. Medication Duplication (Diuretics): Both Torsemide and Furosemide, which are both loop diuretics, are prescribed. Patients are typically prescribed only one loop diuretic. 
6. Polypharmacy (Laxatives): Docusate Sodium, Polyethylene Glycol, and Senna (three different types of laxatives) are all prescribed concurrently. While bowel regimens can be complex post-stroke, prescribing all three simultaneously is extensive and typically requires strong justification for severe constipation, which is not mentioned. 
7. Unjustified Medications: Allopurinol and Colchicine are prescribed, which are typically used for gout. Gout is not mentioned anywhere in the discharge diagnosis, risk factors, or patient history, making these medications appear out of context. 
8. Formatting/Clarity Issues in Medication List: The 'DAILY16' and 'DAILY17' appended to Aspirin and Warfarin, respectively, are unusual and likely system artifacts or typos.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Jensen,

You were admitted to the hospital after you experienced a stroke. You 
were found to have a blood clot in your brain which was causing some 
of the damage seen on imaging. The neurology team felt that this 
stroke was most likely due to a combination of factors including 
your high cholesterol, diabetes and smoking history.

You were treated with medications to thin out your blood (Plavix) 
and to prevent you from having another stroke. You will continue 
to take these medications at home as well as your other 
medications for high cholesterol and blood pressure control.

The physical therapists worked with you while you were in the 
hospital and felt that you had made sufficient progress so that 
you are safe to go home. They recommended that you wear compression 
stockings on your legs when walking or standing for long periods 
of time. The occupational therapists also worked with you and 
felt that you have the skills necessary to take care of yourself at 
home.

The neurologists felt that it is safe for you to return home as well 
and that you do not need further inpatient rehabilitation at this 
time. They recommended that you follow up with your primary care 
physician within the next week and schedule an appointment with a 
neurologist in two weeks for re-evaluation of your stroke.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your Ramirez Medical Center Team

Dear Mr. Reyes, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Eastwood Medical Center.  
You were admitted to the pediatric medicine service with 
fever and abdominal pain. You had an ultrasound of your abdomen 
which showed that there was no fluid in your abdomen or signs of 
infection.

We started you on antibiotics for possible infection of your 
appendix, but the ultrasound did not show evidence that your 
appendix is infected. We will continue you on these antibiotics 
for 7 more days to be sure that your symptoms are due to a 
non-infectious cause and not an infection of your appendix.

We also started you on medications for nausea and pain control.  
You should take the pain medication every 6 hours as needed, but 
do not take it closer than 4 hours apart.
Please follow up with your primary care physician (PCP) in 
Barnes within one week of discharge from the hospital to ensure 
that there is no evidence of infection or other complications.

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Eastwood Medical Center.  

Sincerely, 

Your Eastwood Medical Center Team
 
Followup Instructions:
Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel in 1-2 weeks to monitor your progress and adjust treatment as needed based on any changes in symptoms or test results. If you experience worsening symptoms or have concerns before then, please contact our office for immediate attention. We will also be sending a summary of your care plan to your primary care physician for ongoing management.",good,"1. **Severe Medication Dosing Errors for a Pediatric Patient:** The prescribed doses for a 5-year-old child are dangerously high and represent severe overdoses: a) Ibuprofen 600 mg PO Q8H is an adult dose; a typical dose for a 5-year-old would be significantly lower and weight-based (e.g., 5-10 mg/kg/dose). b) Ciprofloxacin HCl 500 mg PO Q12H is also an adult dose; for a 5-year-old, ciprofloxacin would be weight-based (e.g., 10-20 mg/kg/dose) and much lower. These doses could lead to serious adverse effects. 2. **Inappropriate Antibiotic Therapy and Contradictory Clinical Reasoning:** The note states the ultrasound 'did not show evidence that your appendix is infected' and that the intention is to treat symptoms due to a 'non-infectious cause.' Despite this, the patient is being continued on Ciprofloxacin (an adult-dose antibiotic, and generally not first-line for appendicitis, especially after it's ruled out) for 7 days. This is a fundamental medical reasoning error; antibiotics are for bacterial infections, not for non-infectious causes or when infection has been ruled out. 3. **Inconsistent Medication Dosing Instructions:** The discharge medication list states Ibuprofen 600 mg PO Q8H:PRN, but the discharge instructions state, 'You should take the pain medication every 6 hours as needed, but do not take it closer than 4 hours apart.' This discrepancy in frequency (Q8H vs. Q6H/Q4H minimum) is confusing and could lead to medication errors. 4. **Inappropriate Recipient for Discharge Instructions:** The discharge instructions are addressed to 'Dear Mr. Reyes,' while the patient's date of birth (2019-06-14) indicates he is a 5-year-old child. Instructions for a minor should be addressed to the parents or guardians. 5. **Conflicting Follow-up Instructions:** The 'Discharge Instructions' state, 'Please follow up with your primary care physician (PCP) in Barnes within one week.' However, the 'Followup Instructions' state, 'Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel in 1-2 weeks.' This creates confusion regarding who to follow up with and the timeline for that follow-up.","Name:  Kaius Reyes                   Unit No:   2425091

Dear Ms. Marquez,

You were admitted to the pediatric ward after an injury to your

You had surgery on Garcia to repair the nerves in your wrist.

Please follow these instructions:

1) Please call Dr. Julianne Patel office and schedule a follow up 
appointment for 2 weeks from today.
2) Keep your dressing clean, dry, and intact. You may shower but 
ask someone else to remove the dressing after you are done. If it is 
near the end of its time, you can ask them to change it as well.

Patient Addressing Inconsistency: The patient, Astrid Marquez, is a 9-year-old female, but the discharge instructions address her as 'Ms. Marquez,' which is inappropriate for a child. 2. Typographical Error: The statement 'You had surgery on Garcia to repair the nerves in your wrist' contains a clear typographical error; 'Garcia' likely should be a date or a specific anatomical location. 3. Medication Dosing Errors: All prescribed discharge medications appear to be dosed for an adult rather than a 9-year-old child, posing significant safety concerns. Specifically: a. Acetaminophen 325 mg PO Q4H PRN Pain - This dose is typically for adults; pediatric dosing is weight-based and usually lower. b. Ciprofloxacin HCl 500 mg PO Q12H - This is an adult dose; pediatric ciprofloxacin dosing is weight-based and significantly lower. c. Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID - This is an adult dose; pediatric docusate dosing is weight-based and much lower. d. Ondansetron 8 mg PO Q6H PRN nausea - This is typically an adult dose; pediatric ondansetron dosing is weight-based and often maxes at 4 mg for children <40kg. e. Polyethylene Glycol 17 g PO DAILY - This is the standard adult dose; pediatric dosing for polyethylene glycol is weight-based and typically much lower. 4. Inconsistent Follow-up Instructions: The 'Discharge Instructions' state to schedule a follow-up appointment for '2 weeks from today,' while the 'Followup Instructions' section states to 'Follow up with Dr. Julianne Patel in 1 week,' creating a direct contradiction. 5. Ambiguous Dressing Instructions: The instruction 'You may shower but ask someone else to remove the dressing after you are done. If it is near the end of its time, you can ask them to change it as well' is unclear and potentially contradictory. It conflicts with the instruction to 'Keep your dressing clean, dry, and intact' without specifying if the dressing is waterproof, how to protect it during showering, or when/how exactly it should be removed or changed after showering. This lacks crucial details for proper post-operative wound care in a pediatric patient.","Name:  Astrid Marquez                    Unit No:   2426549

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Sanchez,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your recent 
admission to the gynecology service at Southbrook Community Hospital. 
You were admitted for a planned laparoscopic tubal ligation. The 
procedure went smoothly and you tolerated it well. You had no 
complications from the procedure and are now ready to be 
discharged home.

Please follow up with your primary care physician in the next 
week as an outpatient. We have also made an appointment for you 
with a gynecologist who will continue to manage your birth control 
needs.

If you experience any of the following symptoms, please seek 
medical attention immediately:

*Severe abdominal pain
*Bleeding greater than 1 pad x hour
*Fever > 101.5

We wish you all the best in your future endeavors!

Sincerely,
Your Southbrook Community Hospital Team

The discharge instructions explicitly state, 'The procedure went smoothly and you tolerated it well. You had no complications from the procedure'. Prescribing multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics without any signs or documentation of infection is a significant medical reasoning error and clinically inappropriate. 
3. **Amoxicillin-Clavulanate Dosing Error:** The RX details for Amoxicillin-Clavulanate (Augmentin 875 mg-125 mg) state '2 tablet(s) by mouth every twelve (12) hours'. This implies a dose of 1750 mg-250 mg BID, which is an extreme and potentially toxic overdose. The standard adult dose for this strength is one tablet (875 mg-125 mg) every 12 hours. 
4. **Amoxicillin-Clavulanate Typo:** The medication list shows 'Amoxicillin-Clavulanate Potter mg', which contains a typo ('Potter' instead of a dosage number). 
5. **Oxybutynin Dosing Inconsistency:** The discharge medication list states 'Oxybutynin Chloride 10 mg PO TID', but the accompanying RX details state 'every twelve (12) hours' (BID). This is a direct factual inconsistency. 
6. **Contradictory Birth Control Follow-up:** The discharge instructions state, 'We have also made an appointment for you with a gynecologist who will continue to manage your birth control needs'. A laparoscopic tubal ligation is a permanent form of birth control, making the statement about 'continuing to manage birth control needs' contradictory and a clinical logic error. 
7. **Unjustified Medications Without Context:** Several medications (Oxybutynin, Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray, Loratadine, Omeprazole, Calcium Carbonate, and Vitamin D) are listed without any stated indication or context related to the patient's admission, procedure, or medical history. While a patient might have pre-existing conditions warranting these, their inclusion as discharge medications without any explanation in the note makes their prescription appear clinically unjustified for this specific admission. 
8. **Levofloxacin 1-Day Duration:** Prescribing Levofloxacin for a duration of only '1 Day' as a discharge medication is highly unusual. While a single prophylactic dose might be given peri-operatively, a 1-day course for a diagnosed infection would be insufficient, and its presence alongside three other antibiotics for an uncomplicated surgery is illogical.","Name:  Karen Sanchez                    Unit No:   1438768
