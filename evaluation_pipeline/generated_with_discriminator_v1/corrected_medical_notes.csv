Dear Mr. Blackwood,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Northbrook Community Hospital.  You were admitted to the 
hospital after a fall with right hip dislocation and left shoulder 
dislocation. You underwent reduction of your right hip dislocation 
in the emergency department, and your left shoulder dislocation was 
reduced by orthopedics on Jones. Your pain has been managed with 
oral medications, and you have not had any fevers or increased red 
cell counts in your urine. 

Because you are having difficulty walking independently, we are 
discharging you to a rehab facility where you will receive physical 
therapy to help you regain your strength and independence. You will 
also be followed closely by the orthopedic surgeons after discharge 
from rehab.

We wish you all the best!

Sincerely,
Your Northbrook Community Hospital Team

Dear Mr. Ryder,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Mountainbrook Regional Hospital.  You were admitted to the hospital with chest pain, shortness of breath and nausea/vomiting. Your EKG showed evidence of a heart attack. A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed that your left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was 90% blocked by a blood clot. This was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The LAD artery was opened up and a stent placed to keep it open. You were monitored overnight and remained stable.

You will need to follow up with your primary care physician and cardiologist as listed below. We have made an appointment for you on Brown at 2:00 pm with Dr. Julianne Patel. Please attend this appointment so that we can assess whether or not you are ready to be discharged home safely.

Please continue taking all of your medications as prescribed, unless otherwise instructed by your physician.
 
Followup Instructions:
Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel in 1-2 weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as needed based on laboratory results and clinical assessment. Please notify her office if you experience any worsening symptoms or concerns prior to the scheduled visit. During this time, continue to take all medications as prescribed and attend any additional appointments specified by Dr. Julianne Patel's team. If your condition improves significantly before the scheduled follow-up, contact Dr. Julianne Patel's office for guidance on whether an earlier appointment is necessary.","good","Age 72 with diagnosis 'Acute Coronary Syndrome' is plausible, but 'Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)' is less likely given the primary diagnosis; COPD is more common in smokers or those with a history of smoking, but Mr. Ryder's note does not mention smoking status.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Ryder,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Mountainbrook Regional Hospital.  You were admitted to the hospital with chest pain, shortness of breath and nausea/vomiting. Your EKG showed evidence of a heart attack. A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed that your left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was 90% blocked by a blood clot. This was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The LAD artery was opened up and a stent placed to keep it open. You were monitored overnight and remained stable.

You will need to follow up with your primary care physician and cardiologist as listed below. We have made an appointment for you on Brown at 2:00 pm with Dr. Julianne Patel. Please attend this appointment so that we can assess whether or not you are ready to be discharged home safely.

Please continue taking all of your medications as prescribed, unless otherwise instructed by your physician.
 
Followup Instructions:
Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel in 1-2 weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as needed based on laboratory results and clinical assessment. Please notify her office if you experience any worsening symptoms or concerns prior to the scheduled visit. During this time, continue to take all medications as prescribed and attend any additional appointments specified by Dr. Julianne Patel's team. If your condition improves significantly before the scheduled follow-up, contact Dr. Julianne Patel's office for guidance on whether an earlier appointment is necessary. 
Dr. Julianne Patel would like you to see her in 3 weeks to re-evaluate your acute coronary syndrome diagnosis and adjust treatment as needed based on laboratory results and clinical assessment at that time. Please schedule this follow-up appointment by calling Dr. Julianne Patel's office within the next week. If you experience any worsening symptoms or concerns before then, please contact Dr. Julianne Patel's team immediately. 
Please note that it is essential to continue taking all medications as prescribed during this period and attend any additional appointments specified by Dr. Julianne Patel's team. If your condition improves significantly before the scheduled follow-up, Dr. Julianne Patel's office will provide further guidance on whether an earlier appointment is necessary.","corrected"

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Jensen,

You were admitted to the hospital after you experienced a stroke. You 
were found to have a blood clot in your brain which was causing some 
of the damage seen on imaging. The neurology team felt that this 
stroke was most likely due to a combination of factors including 
your high cholesterol, diabetes and smoking history.

You were treated with medications to thin out your blood (Plavix) 
and to prevent you from having another stroke. You will continue 
to take these medications at home as well as your other 
medications for high cholesterol and blood pressure control.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Jensen,

You were admitted to the hospital after you experienced a stroke. You 
were found to have a blood clot in your brain which was causing some 
of the damage seen on imaging. The neurology team felt that this 
stroke was most likely due to a combination of factors including 
your high cholesterol, diabetes and smoking history.

You were treated with medications to thin out your blood (Plavix) 
and to prevent you from having another stroke. You will continue 
to take these medications at home as well as your other 
medications for high cholesterol and blood pressure control.

The physical therapists worked with you while you were in the 
hospital and felt that you had made sufficient progress so that 
you are safe to go home. They recommended that you wear compression 
stockings on your legs when walking or standing for long periods 
of time. The occupational therapists also worked with you and 
felt that you have the skills necessary to take care of yourself at 
home.

The neurologists felt that it is safe for you to return home as well 
and that you do not need further inpatient rehabilitation at this 
time. They recommended that you follow up with your primary care 
physician within the next week and schedule an appointment with a 
neurologist in two weeks for re-evaluation of your stroke.

We wish you the best!

Dear Mr. Reyes, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Eastwood Medical Center.  
You were admitted to the pediatric medicine service with 
fever and abdominal pain. You had an ultrasound of your abdomen 
which showed that there was no fluid in your abdomen or signs of 
infection.

We started you on antibiotics for possible infection of your 
appendix, but the ultrasound did not show evidence that your 
appendix is infected. We will continue you on these antibiotics 
for 7 more days to be sure that your symptoms are due to a 
non-infectious cause and not an infection of your appendix.

We also started you on medications for nausea and pain control.  
You should take the pain medication every 6 hours as needed, but 
do not take it closer than 4 hours apart.
Please follow up with your primary care physician (PCP) in 
Barnes within one week of discharge from the hospital to ensure 
that there is no evidence of infection or other complications.

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Eastwood Medical Center.

admission to the gynecology service at Southbrook Community Hospital. 
You were admitted for a planned laparoscopic tubal ligation. The 
procedure went smoothly and you tolerated it well. You had no 
complications from the procedure and are now ready to be 
discharged home.

Please follow up with your primary care physician in the next 
week as an outpatient. We have also made an appointment for you 
with a gynecologist who will continue to manage your birth control 
needs.

If you experience any of the following symptoms, please seek 
medical attention immediately:

*Severe abdominal pain
*Bleeding greater than 1 pad x hour
*Fever > 101.5

We wish you all the best in your future endeavors!

Sincerely,
Your Southbrook Community Hospital Team

Thank you!","good","Age 31 with diagnosis 'planned laparoscopic tubal ligation' is biologically plausible; however, medications for urinary incontinence (oxybutynin chloride) and constipation (docusate sodium, senna) are not typically prescribed for a planned tubal ligation procedure, which is a gynecological procedure, not urological or gastrointestinal.","Name:  Karen Sanchez                    Unit No:   1438768
