Dear Mr. Blackwood,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Northbrook Community Hospital.  You were admitted to the 
hospital after a fall with right hip dislocation and left shoulder 
dislocation. You underwent reduction of your right hip dislocation 
in the emergency department, and your left shoulder dislocation was 
reduced by orthopedics on Jones. Your pain has been managed with 
oral medications, and you have not had any fevers or increased red 
cell counts in your urine. 

Because you are having difficulty walking independently, we are 
discharging you to a rehab facility where you will receive physical 
therapy to help you regain your strength and independence. You will 
also be followed closely by the orthopedic surgeons after discharge 
from rehab.

We wish you all the best!

Sincerely,
Your Northbrook Community Hospital Team
