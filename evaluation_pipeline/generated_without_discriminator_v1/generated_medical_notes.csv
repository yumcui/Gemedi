Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Williams, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at Oakwood Community Hospital.  You were admitted 
to the hospital for chest pain.  You had an angiogram performed 
which showed a blockage in one of your coronary arteries.  A 
stent was placed to improve blood flow through this artery.  In 
addition, it appears that you have diabetes mellitus type II.  
This is a chronic condition where your body does not produce 
enough insulin and therefore the cells in your body cannot use 
the glucose from food for energy.

We started you on two new medications to help prevent future 
heart attacks: metoprolol succinate 25mg daily and lisinopril 20mg 
daily.  You will need to continue taking these medications as 
long as you live with the exception of having severe shortness 
of breath where it is not relieved by sitting up or turning your 
head to one side.  Please DO NOT take any NSAIDs, such as 
ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) for at least one month.

We also started you on a medication called metformin which will 
help control the level of sugar in your body.  You can continue 
to take this medication until you run out of your current supply, 
at that time please contact your doctor who can prescribe more.  

In addition to these new medications, we stopped one of your 
medications: sertraline (Zoloft) and we decreased the dose of 
your other medicine:  atenolol from 25mg daily to 0mg daily.
 
Followup Instructions:
Return to see Dr. Rachel Sawyer in 1 week for a follow-up appointment to review your progress and adjust treatment as necessary based on any changes in symptoms or test results. If you experience worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms before then, please contact our office immediately to schedule an urgent visit with Dr. Rachel Sawyer."

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with a cervical spine fracture 
and T 10 compression fracture. You had a collar placed in the 
ED and you have been wearing it since then. The orthopedic 
surgeons decided that this fracture did not require surgical 
intervention at this time and they are going to follow you as an 
outpatient. You will need to wear your collar until you see them 
again.

You also developed a rash on your arm with erythema, warmth and 
blanching of the skin. The most likely cause is friction from the 
collar. This should improve with time without treatment.
 
Followup Instructions:
Please return to see Dr. Julianne Patel in 2 weeks for re-evaluation of your cervical spine fracture and T10 compression fracture, as well as to discuss any further treatment or rehabilitation needs you may have at this time.

Dear Mr. Mitchell,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had a 
myocardial infarction (heart attack). You underwent cardiac 
catheterization and a stent was placed in your left anterior 
descending artery, which is one of the main blood vessels that 
supplies oxygenated blood to your heart muscle. The catheter 
procedure went well without complications.

You were transferred to the cardiac floor for further management 
of your chest pain symptoms. You continued to have chest pain 
when you would walk or go up stairs but this resolved within 10-15 
minutes of resting in a chair or bed.

Your heart rate and blood pressure remained stable. There was no 
evidence of a pulmonary embolism on imaging, but we recommend 
that you follow-up with your primary care doctor to get an EKG 
done at the time of your annual physical exam this year.
 
Followup Instructions:
Please return to see Dr. Karen Brown in 4 weeks for a re-evaluation of your coronary artery disease and to discuss any changes to your treatment plan as needed. Additionally, please contact our office immediately if you experience any worsening symptoms or concerns between now and then."

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Smith, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization at Springdale Community Hospital.  You were 
admitted to the hospital because of food getting stuck in 
your throat (dysphagia). You underwent an endoscopy which 
showed that there was a stricture in your esophagus from a burn 
injury many years ago. This is a scar tissue narrowing in the 
esophagus and you will need to have this dilated regularly. 

You were also admitted with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, 
and diarrhea. We did an endoscopy (EGD) of your upper GI tract 
which showed inflammation of the esophagus that was not due to 
an infection like a virus or bacteria. Your symptoms improved 
with fluids and we did not need to treat you further with 
medications.

You will need to follow up with Dr. Julianne Marquez, who is 
your primary care doctor as well as your gastroenterologist 
(GI doctor). You have an appointment with her in two weeks to 
follow-up on the endoscopy and to discuss when you should have 
the stricture dilated again.

We wish you all the best! 

Sincerely, 
Your Carver Care Team
 
Followup Instructions:

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with chest pain and we found a blockage in one 
of the arteries that brings blood to your heart.  We performed 
a procedure called a cardiac catheterization, which involved 
using a thin tube (called a catheter) to inject dye into the 
arteries of your heart. This allowed us to see the extent of the 
blockages and we found one blockage in your right coronary 
artery that was partially blocking blood flow to your heart.  
We also performed a procedure called an angioplasty, which 
involved using a balloon to open up the blockage in your artery.  
After this procedure, you were monitored overnight with a EKG 
and a monitor attached to your chest and no new signs of damage 
were seen.

You will need to take aspirin and Plavix (Plxy) to prevent blood 
from clotting inside your arteries.  You should also follow up 
with the cardiologist Dr. Julianne Marlowe in the next few days or 
week, as they would like to see you for a check of your heart's 
electrical activity.

It is important that you continue to take care of yourself after 
this event by eating well and continuing to exercise regularly. 
 
Followup Instructions:
Return to see Dr. Julianne Marlowe in 1 week for re-evaluation of your coronary artery disease and to discuss further management options, or sooner if you experience any worsening symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath. Be sure to inform her office staff of your need for urgent follow-up upon scheduling your appointment. Regular monitoring by Dr. Julianne Marlowe will help ensure that your condition continues to improve and that any necessary adjustments are made to your treatment plan."

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Fothergill,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission to 
the hospital.  You were admitted for shortness of breath and low 
blood pressure. We felt that this was due to the heart not 
pumping well, which is concerning given your history of heart 
disease and prior heart attack. The echocardiogram showed that 
your left ventricle has decreased pumping function, but it did 
not show any evidence for a significant blockage in one of the 
heart's blood vessels.

In order to help you better tolerate activities while at home, 
we have started you on an ACE inhibitor (Losartan) and beta 
blocker (Metoprolol Succinate XL). These medications are very 
important in helping your heart function well. We also want to 
make sure that your blood pressure does not become too low when 
you are at home.

We made a change to your medications while you were here in the 
hospital. Please stop taking Amlodipine (Norvasc) and start 
taking Losartan 100 mg once daily. Also, please take Metoprolol 
Succinate XL 50mg once daily. 

While you are recovering at home, it is very important that you 
do not smoke or be around others who are smoking. It is also very 
important to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.

Please follow up with your primary care physician and 
cardiologist as scheduled below.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Jensen,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization 
at Bayshore Medical Center.  You were admitted to the Surgery 
service after having abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for 
several days. An ultrasound of your abdomen showed that you have 
a condition called diverticulitis which is an inflammation of 
your colon. This most likely occurred due to a blockage in one 
of the small pouches in your intestine. In order to make sure this 
does not get worse, we are sending you home with antibiotics and 
to follow up with your surgeon who will monitor you for signs of 
infection or other complications.

Your abdominal pain improved while you were here and you have 
been tolerating a regular diet. We recommend that you continue 
to eat small frequent meals to decrease the discomfort from 
abdominal distension. If your symptoms worsen, please seek care 
from your primary physician or return to the emergency room if 
you believe your condition is life threatening.

Please follow up with your surgeon in one week for a post op 
visit and as you will be discharged on antibiotics, this visit is 
important so that we can assess whether further treatment is 
required. We also recommend that you continue to take your other 
medications as prescribed by your physicians prior to coming to 
the hospital.

Please seek medical attention if you develop any of the signs 
and symptoms listed below:
* severe abdominal pain
* vomiting and inability to keep down fluids or food
* fevers greater than 101 degrees
* chills
* blood in stool
* chest pain

Thank you for allowing us to be a part of your care,

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Rylan, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Johnsonland Regional Hospital.  You were admitted 
for diarrhea. Your stool cultures showed no evidence of bacterial or parasitic 
infection. Your CT scan did not show any signs of infection in the intestines. 
You had a colonoscopy which showed that your small intestine is connected to 
your colon (a condition called short gut). This will cause chronic diarrhea and 
you should follow up with your gastroenterologist regularly to make sure this 
does not worsen. 

In addition, you have a new rash on the back of your legs that is concerning for 
shingles, so please follow up with your primary care doctor.

Please continue to take all of your medications as prescribed and keep all of 
your scheduled appointments. 

Sincerely,

Your Davisland Regional Hospital Team

Dear Ms. Wilder, 

It was a pleasure taking part in your care at Lincoln Regional Hospital.  

You were admitted to the hospital with a right hand fracture.  
Your hand x-rays showed a fracture of two bones in your wrist and 
two small bones in your fingers called metacarpals.  The orthopedic 
surgeons felt that your fractures could be treated non-operatively 
without surgery.  They recommend that you keep your arm at rest, 
keep it elevated to decrease swelling and use ice packs every 
four hours as needed for pain or discomfort.  Please avoid any 
activities that may worsen the swelling of your hand.  

You will need to follow up with an orthopedic surgeon at Lincoln Regional Hospital.  Dr. Julianne Marquez have made you an appointment with Dr. Julianne Marquez on Brown, please keep this 
appointment so that we can remove the splint and start you on a 
course of physical therapy. 

If there is anything else we can do for you, or if you have any 
questions, please don't hesitate to call your doctor or nurse 
practitioner.

We wish you all the best in your recovery!

Sincerely,
Your Medical Team at Lincoln Regional Hospital

Dear Ms. Marquez,

It was a pleasure caring for you at South Chrisman Medical Center.  
You were admitted to the hospital after having chest pain.  
During your stay, we performed tests to find out why you had 
your chest pain. These tests showed that one of your arteries is 
partially blocked and this is most likely the reason for your 
chest pain. We started you on medication called metoprolol to 
help reduce the amount of blood flow through this artery when it 
is constricted.

You will be following up with your outpatient cardiologist, Dr. Julianne Sloane, 
who will determine if you need further testing or intervention 
with one of the interventional cardiologists at South Chrisman Medical Center.  

Please call your doctor or return to the emergency department if 
you have any shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, 
lightheadedness, dizziness, or any other symptoms that are of 
concern to you.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care,
Your Cardiology Team
 
Followup Instructions:
Please schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Sloane in 1-2 weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as needed. If symptoms worsen or new concerns arise before then, contact our office to arrange an urgent visit with Dr. Julianne Sloane. We will also be sending a letter to your primary care physician with updates on your recent hospitalization and ongoing care plan. Thank you for entrusting us with your cardiovascular health!"

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Wilson,
 
You were admitted to the pediatric service at North Michael 
Community Hospital.  You were found to have a Baker cyst, which 
is a cyst that forms behind your knee.  The cyst is a fluid 
collection.  Sometimes this can be drained with a needle.
 
Your blood work was normal.
 
We do not think you needed any physical therapy while you were 
here.
 
We also do not think you need to follow up in the Levine clinic 
after discharge, but please call your primary care physician 
to make an appointment for further evaluation of your blood 
pressure and cholesterol levels.
 
Please take all medications as prescribed.  We have given you 
a prescription for oxycodone, which is a narcotic pain reliever.  
Please do not drive while taking this medication or any other 
narcotic pain relievers.

We wish you the best of health,
Your North Michael Community Hospital Team

INSTRUCTIONS AFTER SPINE SURGERY

- You were in the hospital for 1 day after your surgery. This is 
a normal amount of time for this type of procedure. 

- Please call the office if you experience any numbness, 
tingling, weakness, loss of reflexes, or bowel/bladder dysfunction 
in your lower extremities.

- Avoid heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, or bending for 6 weeks 
as this can put additional stress on your spine and the surgical 
site. 

- You should be able to shower in 2 days after surgery. Let the 
water run over your incision; do not use a shower head to spray 
the area.

- Do not take any anti-inflammatory medication such as Motrin, 
Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Advil, Aleve, or Nuprin for at least 4 weeks 
as this can further irritate the spine and surgical site. 

- You may start driving when you feel comfortable and able to do 
so, but no driving while taking narcotics.

- Resume your home medications unless otherwise instructed.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for an ovarian cyst. This was 
removed surgically and sent to pathology, which did not show any 
cancer cells in it. You tolerated this surgery well without any 
complications. 

You are now ready to be discharged home with the following 
instructions:

Do not drive until you are no longer taking pain medications.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any narcotics 
(pain relievers such as oxycodone, percocet, vicodin) for 2 weeks 
after surgery. You may use over the counter pain medication like 
Tylenol or ibuprofen if needed.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber to prevent constipation
You should not eat constipating foods such as cheese, dairy, 
milk, ice cream, bread, pasta, beef, pork for 4-6 weeks after 
surgery. You may have small amounts of these foods but they are 
not good for you right now.
You may shower and wash incisions gently with warm soapy water. 
Rinse clean and pat dry. You may apply a thin layer of Vaseline or
Aquaphor with gauze over the incision. Change this dressing daily 
if it is open, otherwise change every other day. 
Do not soak your incisions in a bath or pool for at least 4-6 
weeks after surgery.
You may have a light headed feeling when standing or walking due 
to the anesthesia given during surgery. This will improve over 
time and you will get used to it. If you feel faint, sit down or 
lay down and put your feet up, drink some water and take slow 
deep breaths. 
You may experience fatigue (feeling tired) for a few weeks after 
surgery. You should try to walk several times per day for 10-15 
minutes.
Your appetite will be decreased immediately after surgery but 
will improve with time. Try small frequent meals and snacks. It 
is normal for your bowel movements to be slow at first and they 
will return to normal within a few weeks. If you have severe 
diarrhea or blood in the stool,"

Dear Ms. Marquez, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at North David Regional Hospital.  You were admitted to the urology

renal colic.
* You may resume taking your normal medications unless told not to by your doctor.
* Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you 
experience any fevers >101.5, chills, increased pain, nausea/vomiting, inability to urinate or 
have blood in your urine.

We wish you a speedy recovery! 

Sincerely, 
Your Lopez team

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. Nelson,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at East Christopher Community Hospital.  You were admitted for chest pain, 
which was concerning for a heart attack. An ultrasound test 
called an echocardiogram did not show evidence of a heart attack, 
but it showed that one of your blood vessels was blocked by a 
plaque (like hard fat). This plaque can cause damage to the 
blood vessel and lead to a heart attack if left untreated.

A procedure called angiography was performed. It is an imaging 
test where dye is injected into your blood vessels, and pictures 
are taken using special X-ray cameras. The test showed that one of 
your arteries was blocked by the plaque. This artery supplies 
blood to your heart muscle. A stent (a small mesh tube) was placed 
in this artery to keep it open and allow blood to flow freely.

You are being discharged home with a new medication called 
atorvastatin, which will help lower cholesterol in your blood.
Cholesterol can contribute to the formation of plaque in your 
blood vessels. You should also continue taking aspirin daily to 
help prevent another blockage from occurring.

It is very important that you follow up with Dr. Julianne Sawyer as an outpatient. She will check how well your heart is doing and remove any stitches or staples that may be needed. If you have a fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms before your appointment, please call her office immediately.
 
Followup Instructions:
Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Sawyer in 1-2 weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as necessary. Please notify the doctor's office if you experience any worsening symptoms or concerns between appointments."

Discharge Instructions:
You have been discharged with a right mini-open posterior 
lumbar fusion at L3-L4.  Please follow the instructions below to 
ensure a safe and healthy recovery:

1) You should be able to resume your normal diet, but it is best 
to avoid heavy lifting for several weeks after surgery.
2) If you have been instructed to wear a brace or back cast, 
you must wear it at all times until follow-up with the doctor.  
You will not need this once the bone in your back has healed, 
but this may take as long as 6 weeks to 3 months for some people.  
Please do not get the brace wet if you plan on wearing it after 
this time.
3) You may shower immediately after surgery, but you must cover 
the incision with plastic bags or waterproof bandages in order 
to keep your incision dry until follow-up.
4) You should NOT smoke for several months to allow the bone and 
soft tissue of the spine to heal.  Smoking can lead to a long 
term increase in pain after surgery, so it is very important 
that you stop smoking for good.
5) It is normal to feel tired or ""washed out"" after this type of 
surgery.  You should try to rest as much as possible and avoid 
heavy activity until your follow-up visit with the doctor.
6) You may resume your regular activities at your own pace when 
you are no longer experiencing pain.  Please do NOT lift anything 
greater than 5 pounds for several weeks after surgery, or until 
your follow-up visit with the doctor.

MEDICATIONS:
1) Percocet (oxycodone/acetaminophen):  Please take as directed 
by your physicians to control post-operative pain.
2) Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen: This medication is NOT allowed by 
our hospital or surgery center.  It must be discontinued 
immediately.  
3) Tylenol (acetaminophen):  Take as needed for pain.  Please do 
not exceed 4 grams of acetaminophen per day.
4) Narcotic Pain Medications (oxycodone, percocet etc.):
Please note that narcotic pain medications can cause constipation 
and you should"

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Slade,

It was a pleasure caring for you at Lincoln Medical Center.  You were admitted 
because you were feeling down after your recent heart attack. We think this is 
due to depression. This can be very common after such an event, but it is 
important to address the feelings so that they do not continue or worsen.

You had a cardiac catheterization which showed no significant blockage in any of 
the arteries supplying blood to your heart muscle. You will follow up with 
your cardiologist and primary care physician as listed below.
Your blood work and other tests were negative for infection and did not show 
evidence that you are having a reaction to the medications you were given.

You should continue to take all of your medicines as prescribed, and attend 
all of your follow-up appointments. You may also benefit from seeking out 
psychological counseling or support groups to help manage the emotional 
aspects of your recent heart attack.
 
Followup Instructions:
Please return to see Dr. Julianne Marquez in 2 weeks for a routine check-in to assess progress and adjust treatment plan as necessary. If you experience any worsening symptoms or concerns before then, do not hesitate to contact our office to schedule an emergency appointment with Dr. Julianne Marquez.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Davis,

You were admitted to the hospital with left groin pain and found 
to have a hernia at the time of surgery on 4/10/2025. Your postoperative course was complicated by pain, nausea, and vomiting. 
However, you are now tolerating a regular diet, your pain is well 
controlled with oral analgesics, and you are ready to be 
discharged home.

Please follow these instructions to ensure a speedy recovery:

MEDICATIONS:
1)  Resume taking all medications as directed on discharge.
2)  Continue to take prescription pain medication as directed. 
This medication can cause constipation; therefore, you should 
drink eight 8oz glasses of water daily and take a stool softener 
(e.g., colace) as needed to prevent this side effect.
3)  Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking narcotic 
pain medications.

ACTIVITY:
1)  Resume normal activity slowly. You will be more comfortable 
and less likely to pull your hernia if you go up and down stairs 
only, get up from a seated position only, and refrain from lifting 
greater than 10 pounds for the next few weeks.
2)  Avoid heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling greater than 10 lbs 
for 6 weeks.
3)  You may resume sexual activity as soon as you feel comfortable 
doing so. However, do not use a seat belt if you have a inguinal 
hernia repair.

CALL YOUR SURGEON IMMEDIATELY IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE 
FOLLOWING:

*Severe pain that is not relieved by your pain medication.
*Prolonged or severe vomiting where you are not able to keep 
down fluids or your medications.
*Fevers >101.5 degrees F for 24 hours.
*Shaking chills
*Redness, swelling, increased drainage from incision(s)
*If you see dark or ""currant jelly"" blood when you use the 
bathroom

Thank you for allowing us to be a part of your care!
 
Followup Instructions:
Follow up with Dr. Julianne Patel in 1 week to have your sutures removed and to discuss post-operative care instructions for your left inguinal hernia repair. If you experience any increase in pain or discomfort before then, please contact her office immediately for further guidance. During this time, continue to take your medications as prescribed and avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity. It is essential that you attend this follow-up appointment to ensure proper healing and prevent potential complications.

Dear Mr. Powell,

You were admitted to the ICU for monitoring after a CT scan 
showed that you had an injury to your lung that was consistent 
with a contusion.  You developed a pneumothorax on the right side 
of your chest, but this resolved with a chest tube.  While in 
the ICU, you were treated with oxygen and steroids for your 
shortness of breath.

You are now being discharged home to complete your course of 
steroids as directed by the doctors at your outpatient 
appointment on Davis.  You should continue to take your home 
oxygen when you use your inhalers or feel short of breath.  It is 
likely that your lung injury will heal over time and you may be 
able to stop using your oxygen in the future, but this has not 
been determined yet.

Please follow up with the doctors as directed below.
 
Followup Instructions:
Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel in 1-2 weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as needed for continued recovery from R lung contusion and R pneumothorax. Please call our office to schedule an appointment at least 24 hours in advance to ensure availability.

Dear Ms. Morales,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent

to have this CBC checked frequently during the next two weeks 
as part of monitoring for chemotherapy effects. Please follow up 
with Dr. Julianne Sawyer as scheduled.

Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you develop 
any concerning symptoms such as fevers greater than 101, 
chills, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, shortness 
of breath, chest pain or pressure, arm or leg swelling, severe 
headache, confusion or any other symptoms that are concerning to 
you.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Moreno, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay.  
You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of your 
esophagus with biopsies taken.  The results showed that you have 
eosinophilic esophagitis which is an allergic reaction causing 
swelling and inflammation in the esophagus leading to difficulty 
swallowing, abdominal pain, food getting stuck, etc.

The treatment for this disease involves dilating the narrowed 
area of your esophagus and taking steroids to suppress your 
allergic response.  You also have GERD which may be contributing 
to your symptoms and you should continue to take your medications 
for that condition as well.

Dear Ms. Jensen,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Northshore Community Healthcare System. 

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL? 
- You came to the hospital because your heart rate was very high

including metoprolol and diltiazem.  Your heart rate improved over 
time and the rhythm converted back to normal sinus rhythm.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? 
- Continue taking all of your home medications as prescribed.
- Follow up with cardiologists in two weeks for a repeat EKG, 
and we will re-evaluate whether or not you need blood thinners 
again.  You can reach us to schedule this appointment at (262) 345-2121.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Maddox,

You were admitted to the Rodriguez after presenting with slurred 
speech, facial drooping and numbness on your right side. You 
were found to have a stroke involving multiple areas of the 
brain including the brainstem which is responsible for many of 
the functions that control breathing and swallowing.

You had several episodes while you were here where you stopped 
breathing and required assistance with ventilation. We made some 
adjustments to your medications in an attempt to prevent this 
from happening again, but it has been noted that you have a 
history of having difficulty breathing on the phone and it is 
important that you continue to use your inhaler as prescribed.

You had difficulty swallowing while here at times, and we 
performed several swallow studies. You will need to follow up 
with a speech therapist in order to determine whether or not you 
will require a feeding tube in the future.

We started you on a medication called oxycoDONE for pain control 
and this was increased as needed. We recommend that you continue 
to take this for pain and also try some of the other measures we 
discussed such as heat, ice and tylenol.

You had an MRI of your brain which showed evidence of your 
stroke. You will need to follow up with a neurologist in order to 
determine whether or not you require any further treatment.
 
Followup Instructions:
Return to see Dr. Michael Reed in 4 weeks for re-evaluation and adjustment of treatment plan as needed, or sooner if symptoms worsen or new concerns arise. During this time, please continue to take your medications as prescribed and follow up with your primary care physician for routine check-ins. If you experience any severe headache, numbness, weakness, or vision changes, seek immediate medical attention by calling Dr. Michael Reed's office or visiting the nearest emergency room."

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Ryder,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Lincoln Park Community Hospital.  You came to the 
hospital after falling and sustaining injuries to your left hip 
and right pelvis. You had surgery on both areas and are now ready 
to be discharged home.

Please follow these instructions when you go home:

* Take all medications as prescribed.
* Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking narcotics 
(Percocet, oxycodone). Narcotic pain relievers can also cause 
constipation, so you should drink eight 8oz glasses of water per 
day and take a stool softener (such as Colace) as needed to avoid 
this side effect. 
* Do not combine narcotic pain medications with sedatives (such 
as benzodiazepines), tranquilizers, muscle relaxants or alcohol.  
Narcotic pain relievers can also cause drowsiness, so you should 
not operate heavy machinery or drive a car while taking these 
medications.
* If the pain in your hips and pelvis is not improving within 72 
hours or is worsening at any time, call your surgeon's office for 
further instructions.
* You may restart your home blood thinner (Coumadin) today. Please 
follow-up with your PCP to monitor your INR levels closely.

Activity:
* Non-weight bearing on left lower extremity
* Weight bearing as tolerated on right lower"

Dear Ms. Slade,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at Southshore Community Hospital.  You were admitted for 
shortness of breath, which was found to be due to fluid build-up in your lungs.  This has improved with 
fluids and diuretics.  Your labs showed no signs of infection or heart attack.  We 
started you on Lasix (a medication that helps remove extra fluid from the body) and held your 
blood pressure medications, which will be restarted when you are fully discharged from the hospital.

Given your shortness of breath and inability to walk more than a few feet without feeling winded, we 
feel it would be unsafe for you to go home without supplemental oxygen.  You have been set up with 
oxygen delivery at home through a company called O2 Solutions.  We encourage you to use this 
supplemental oxygen as needed.

We are transferring you back to your primary care doctor, Dr. Julianne Patel, who will see you in clinic on 
Stevens, as well as follow up with the pulmonary medicine team.  

Please continue to take all of your medications as prescribed and do not stop any medication without 
talking to your doctor first.

Thank you for allowing us to be a part of your care,

Dear Mr. Garcia,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had a blood clot 
in your lungs, called a pulmonary embolism. You also fell and 
hit your head before being brought to the hospital, where it was 
found that there was bleeding in between the covering of your 
brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage) as well as small bleeds on the 
surface of the brain (subdural hematoma). There were no signs 
of a blood clot in the vessels of your brain. You were started 
on a medicine called warfarin to help prevent another pulmonary 
embolism from occurring.

When you are discharged, please follow-up with Dr. Julianne Slade at Southbrook Community Hospital to determine how long you will need to continue taking this medication for. It is very important that your INR blood tests are monitored closely while on this medicine to make sure it does not get too low or too high. 

Please take all of your medicines as directed.

Return to see Dr. Julianne Slade in 1 week for a follow-up appointment to review test results and discuss any further treatment options as needed. If you experience any worsening symptoms or concerns before then, please contact our office immediately. Thank you!

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Rylan,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay 
here at South Bay Community Healthcare System.  You were 
admitted with pain and discomfort in your abdomen, nausea, and 
vomiting.  We performed an ultrasound to evaluate the gallbladder 
which showed inflammation and sludge, consistent with acute 
cholecystitis (gall bladder infection).  This was likely caused 
by a stone that had become lodged in the bile ducts of your 
liver.  You were treated with IV antibiotics which helped to 
resolve your symptoms.

On the day after admission you underwent surgery to remove your 
gallbladder and also did a procedure called ERCP where the stones 
were extracted from the bile ducts of your liver.  You tolerated 
the procedure well, had a good appetite post operatively with no 
more pain or nausea.  The pathology of the gall bladder was 
examined by pathologists at South Bay Community Healthcare System. and showed normal findings for gallbladder tissue.
The ERCP showed that there were stones in your bile ducts.  You 
were treated with antibiotics and we will follow you to make sure 
that the infection does not recur.

You are now ready to be discharged home, please call your doctor 
or return to the emergency department if you have any worsening of 
your symptoms or any new concerning symptoms such as severe pain, 
nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, abdominal distension etc.

your abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, short 
of breath, weakness and weight loss.  We found gallstones in the 
gallbladder with signs and symptoms consistent with an acute 
cholecystitis, or inflammation of the gallbladder.  We did not do 
a cholecystectomy (surgical removal of the gallbladder) because 
of your heart condition.  Your gall bladder will most likely 
permanently stop functioning.  You may continue to have some 
abdominal pain and bloating but this should improve with time.

We treated you with antibiotics for your acute cholecystitis, 
and we are stopping the antibiotics as of today (day of 
discharge).  We gave you a medication called Ursodiol that will 
help dissolve the gallstones.  You can continue to take this 
medication after discharge until further notice.

Please follow up with Dr. Julianne Sawyer on the day and time 
listed below.  Please call our office at least one week prior to 
schedule or cancel this appointment.  

We wish you all the best,

Your Oakwood Community Hospital Team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Ryder,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at Oakwood Community Hospital.  

You were admitted because you had difficulty walking and you 
had several episodes where you fell to the ground and you lost 
consciousness for a few seconds. We did a MRI scan of your brain 
and spinal cord which showed that you have damage in both areas, 
but more importantly it showed that there is no sign of bleeding 
or stroke in your brain. This suggests that your symptoms are due 
to an injury to your brain rather than to an acute event such as 
a stroke or a bleed.

We also checked the blood tests for signs of infection and we did 
not find anything abnormal. We had you followed by the neurology 
team who were also happy with your progress and agreed that you 
should be sent home to continue your recovery at home. 

Please take all of your medications as prescribed and follow up 
with your appointments as scheduled.

Thank you for letting us participate in your care here at Oakwood Community Hospital.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for your recent colonoscopy and to start a new 
chemotherapy regimen. You did well with the chemotherapy and 
did not have any significant side effects. 

Please continue to take all medications as directed. Please take 
a stool softener such as Colace while taking narcotics (oxycodone 
or morphine) to prevent constipation.

Please follow up with your oncologist as scheduled in order to 
complete the chemotherapy regimen and plan for possible surgery 
in the near future. You will need blood work drawn before each 
chemotherapy treatment, so please arrive at least 30 minutes 
before your appointment time. 

Your appetite may be decreased while you are receiving 
chemotherapy. Eating small frequent meals can help with weight 
maintenance and prevent malnutrition. It is also important to 
stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids throughout the 
day.

Exercise: You should avoid strenuous exercise for 2 weeks after 
your last chemotherapy treatment, but it is okay to go for a walk 
or do some light stretching immediately.
 
Followup Instructions:
Follow up with Dr. Julianne Patel in 1 week to review laboratory results and assess response to recent chemotherapy treatment. Additionally, schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel in 3 weeks to monitor progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. If you experience any changes in symptoms or have concerns before then, please contact our office for guidance on next steps."

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Smith,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at the Mitchell
Neuroscience Institute.  You were admitted after being diagnosed
with an aneurysm in your brain, which was treated with a procedure
called coiling.  This is a common treatment for aneurysms and it 
was done successfully.

Please note that you may still have some headaches following the
procedure.  This can be controlled with pain medications such as 
Ibuprofen or Tylenol.  If your headache worsens, becomes more 
constant, or associated with nausea/vomiting, please contact us 
at the number below for further advice.

You should also continue to increase your intake of fluids and
keep up a high fiber diet to prevent constipation which is a 
common side effect of this type of procedure.  If you are not 
passing stools every day or if you have nausea/vomiting with 
constipation, please contact us for further advice.

You should also resume taking your home medications as prescribed
prior to admission, except while taking the pain medication 
listed below.

Thank you again for letting us participate in your care here at
the Smith.

Sincerely,

Your Allen Neurosurgery Team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Brown,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at Oakwood Community Hospital.  You were admitted 
for shortness of breath and found to have fluid overload in your lungs. We gave you 
medications to remove the excess fluid, and we started you on new doses of Lasix, 
which is a medication that removes excess salt from the body. We are also going to 
change your dialysis prescription to try to help improve your blood pressure.

We think that some of the shortness of breath was due to the fact that your lungs are 
not able to expand as well as they should be because your ribs and lung tissue have 
become stiffer over time, likely from a long history of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease.  We would like you to follow-up with Dr. Julianne Patel at your next dialysis 
appointment.

We are transferring you back to the home care agency for continued skilled nursing 
care.  You will continue to need assistance with most aspects of daily living, but we 
think that you will be able to return home to live comfortably. We wish you all the 
best!

Sincerely,
Your Oakwood Community Hospital Team

Dear Ms. Wilson,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at Eastwood Community Hospital.  You were admitted to the hospital 
because of having seizures. We did further testing which showed that your seizures may be related to a lack of oxygen 
to the brain, possibly due to your sleep apnea or other medical issues.

We treated you with medication for your seizures and you had no further episodes while in the hospital. You were also 
evaluated by our psychiatry team who felt that you would benefit from ongoing care at an assisted living facility. 

Before you left the hospital we started a new medication called oxycodone-acetaminophen to help manage some back pain you 
were experiencing and we increased your dose of gabapentin for your seizures.

Please follow up with your primary care physician Dr. Julianne Sawyer as soon as possible after discharge to discuss 
your ongoing medical needs.

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care,
Your Eastwood Community Hospital Team

Dear Mr. Jackson,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization 
at Bayshore Community Healthcare System.  You were admitted for 
liver failure most likely due to alcohol use.  We worked with the 
alcohol treatment team and they helped you get into rehab at an 
outpatient facility.  They are also going to be following up with 
you in the clinic as well.

You had several labs drawn during your hospitalization that 
showed your liver function improving. You were also seen by our 
gastroenterologist who felt that a transplant was not necessary 
at this time and recommended you continue with rehab and followup 
with his office.  He will be able to assess for any worsening of 
your cirrhosis.

Please continue taking all medications as prescribed, and return 
to the emergency room if you experience any shortness of breath, 
increased abdominal distention or pain, or if you have any other 
concerning symptoms.
 
Followup Instructions:
Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Sawyer in 1-2 weeks to monitor your progress and adjust treatment as needed for your primary diagnosis of cirrhosis.

Dear Ms. Taylor,

It was a pleasure caring for you at Northshore Community Hospital.  You were 
admitted to the surgery service with post op bleeding after your 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The surgical team evaluated you in the OR and 
found that there was some blood in your abdomen which was being drained by 
the surgical drain. Your abdominal pain improved, and your heart rate 
returned to baseline. You were then transferred back to a regular bed on 
the surgery floor.

You had some post op bleeding with your drains, but this resolved. The 
surgeons evaluated you and found that the surgical team was comfortable 
with discharge home at this point in time.

Please follow up with your surgeons as noted below.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care!

Sincerely,

Your Oakwood Medical Group Team

Dear Ms. Fletcher,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent admission to 
Stanhurst Regional Hospital.  You were admitted due to low blood 
counts, which are expected side effects of chemotherapy.  Your 
blood counts improved with the addition of growth factors and 
red cell transfusions.  You also had an episode of atrial 
fibrillation that was treated with a medication called metoprolol 
tartral succinate (100 mg PO BID) and you are being monitored for 
a drop in your potassium levels.

You were seen by the neurologists who felt that your episodes of 
weakness, dizziness, and lightheadedness were due to low blood 
pressures.  They recommended that you stand up slowly when going 
from lying down or sitting, and drink fluids frequently throughout 
the day.  If these symptoms occur again, please call Dr. Julianne Marston 
office at Rodriguezview General Hospital. 

Your total cholesterol is elevated (247 mg/dL), so we recommend 
that you limit dietary intake of fats and oils.

Please continue to take all your medications as prescribed. 
 
Followup Instructions:
Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Marston in 1-2 weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as needed, or sooner if experiencing increased symptoms or side effects. Please contact our office to schedule this appointment at least 24 hours prior to ensure adequate time for review of your medical history and preparation for the visit. During this follow-up, we will assess your response to current treatments and discuss any necessary changes to optimize your care.

Dear Ms. Jensen,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your recent 
hospitalization at West Michael Medical Center. You were 
admitted for concern that your chronic pancreatitis flare may 
be complicated by an infection, likely caused by a urinary tract 
infection or a bladder infection. While you were here, we 
obtained blood cultures and urine tests which showed signs of 
bacteria in your blood. We treated this with antibiotics called 
piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin. You also had an ERCP 
done on Thompson to help relieve blockage in the ducts of your 
pancreas, which can lead to flare ups of your pancreatitis.

You are now being discharged home with the following changes:
- Please continue taking all medications as prescribed.
- Please follow up with your primary care physician and 
gastroenterologist as scheduled.
- You may resume a regular diet.
- Do not consume alcohol. 

Weigh yourself every day in the morning, call MD if weight goes 
up by 3lbs in one day
Please seek medical attention if you develop any of the 
following:
- New onset of tremors or seizures
- Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status
- Any signs of infection: fever >101.4, chills, increased redness 
or drainage from a wound, increased or new joint pain
- Any worsening of symptoms or any new symptoms that concern you

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to 
call the gastroenterology clinic at West Michael Medical Center. 

Good luck,

Your South Michael Medical Center Team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Brooks,

You were admitted to the hospital for a coronary angiogram with 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). You had stents placed 
in two vessels and did well post procedure. 

Your chest pain improved but you still had some chest pain at 
rest, which was concerning. Your heart rhythm and EKG were 
monitored and they were normal without any signs of ischemia or 
infarct. The cardiac catheterization lab performed a repeat 
angiogram of your coronary arteries, which showed no signs of 
blood flow to the areas of the heart that are supplied by the 
vessels with stents in place. You had an EKG and echocardiogram of 
your heart while you were in the hospital, which did not show any 
evidence of a myocardial infarct (heart attack). It is possible 
that you may have a small amount of damage to your heart muscle, 
but there was no significant damage seen on the imaging tests. 

Therefore, we are discharging you home with medications as 
previously discussed.

Please follow up with all of your outpatient appointments as 
scheduled:

- Follow up with your primary care doctor in 1 week
- Follow up with your cardiologist in 2 weeks

We wish you a speedy recovery!

Sincerely,

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Slade,

You were admitted after having a transient event with 
difficulty speaking and understanding. You had a CT scan of the 
brain that was unremarkable, but you had an MRI brain which did 
not show any signs of stroke. A Doppler ultrasound of your neck 
vessels showed no evidence of carotid artery disease.

You were diagnosed with a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also 
known as a ""mini-stroke"". This is when the blood supply to the 
brain is temporarily interrupted, leading to temporary loss of 
neurological function. It is important that you see your primary 
care physician and have your cholesterol and blood pressure 
checked, as these are risk factors for stroke.

You were discharged with some new medications:

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with symptoms of chest pain.  Your EKG showed 
changes consistent with a heart attack but your labs did not 
show the changes we would expect with this diagnosis.  You had 
a cardiac catheterization which showed some narrowing in one of 
the arteries that goes to your heart muscle and this was opened 
up during the procedure.  The area that went without blood flow 
during the procedure was treated with a drug called nitroglycerin 
which helped restore blood flow to the heart muscle.  
You were also started on medications for high blood pressure, 
which you will need to continue when you leave the hospital.
The cardiac catheterization revealed that one of the arteries 
that goes to your heart is 90% blocked. The other artery has a 
blockage but it is not as significant.

If you develop new chest pain or shortness of breath, call your 
doctor or go to the emergency room immediately.

It is very important that you continue to take all of your

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Morales,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at Lincolnwood Community Hospital.  You were admitted to the hospital 
with chest pain that was concerning for a heart attack, but it 
was determined that your heart muscle did not suffer damage 
from being deprived of blood supply. 

You had an angiogram performed which showed that one of your 
heart arteries (the left anterior descending artery) is about 
to close off completely and you need to have this done before 
it causes another heart attack.  You were offered a procedure 
called a stent placement, but the interventional cardiologist 
felt that it was not safe for you to undergo this procedure at 
this time. Instead, he recommended that you discuss with your 
primary care physician whether or not you should have an 
angiogram performed of your neck and legs arteries as well as 
your heart arteries in the future.

You were started on a blood thinner called Aspirin which you 
should continue to take daily for at least 6 months. You also 
were started on a medication called Lisinopril, and this can 
also help prevent you from having another heart attack in the 
future. 

It is very important that you follow up with your primary care 
physician in the next couple of weeks so he can discuss with 
you whether or not you should have your neck and leg arteries 
examined in the future.

If you have any questions, please call Dr. Julianne Patel at Lincolnwood Community Hospital.
 
Followup Instructions:
Please schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel in 4-6 weeks to assess the progression of your coronary artery disease treatment and discuss any necessary adjustments to your medication regimen. During this visit, Dr. Julianne Patel will review your test results and provide personalized guidance on maintaining optimal heart health. Please contact our office if you experience any worsening symptoms or have concerns between now and then. Thank you for entrusting us with your care!"

Dear Mr. Jenkins,

You were admitted to our hospital because you had a blood clot in 
your left subclavian vein. You also had low blood counts. We gave 
you medications to thin your blood so that the clot does not get 
worse.  You will need to continue this medication for at least six 
months, and maybe longer.

We found that you have atrial fibrillation, which is an abnormal 
heart rhythm. This is likely causing your low blood counts. We 
gave you medications to help regulate your heart rhythm. If you 
are experiencing shortness of breath or chest pain, please take a 
puff from your albuterol inhaler every six hours.

Please follow up with Dr. Julianne Patel in two weeks for a repeat 
of the ultrasound that was performed on your blood vessels.

If you have any questions or concerns, please call us at 1-800-MD-
Anderson (1-800-633-4637).

Sincerely,
Your Edwards Care Team

INSTRUCTIONS AFTER ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY:

- You were in the hospital for orthopedic surgery. It is normal 
to feel tired or ""washed out"" after surgery, and this feeling 
should improve over the first few days to week.
  
- Resume your regular activities as tolerated, but please follow 
your weight bearing restrictions strictly.

- Take your pain medicine as directed. If the pain medication is 
too sedating, take it at bedtime only. You can switch from 
narcotic pain medicines (oxycodone, percocet) to tylenol and 
ibuprofen or advil when you are tolerating a diet of solid foods.

- Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking narcotic 
pain medicine.
  
- Resume your home medications unless otherwise instructed. You 
may have been given new prescriptions for pain control or other 
medications - please take these as directed until they run out, 
then resume the original medication.
  
- You may shower and wash incisions with water. No baths or 
swimming for at least 4 weeks. Any stitches or staples that need 
to be removed will come out in 2 weeks.

- If you were given steri-strips (small paper strips) they will 
fall off on their own within the first two weeks after surgery.
  
- It is important to continue to ambulate several times per day 
and to keep your operative joint moving as much as possible."

Dear Mr. Mcdonald,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at St. Catherine Regional Hospital.  You were admitted to the hospital 
because of an abdominal aortic aneurysm which is a bulge in your 
blood vessel that carries blood from your heart to your legs, 
which could rupture and cause death.

You had endovascular repair of your aneurysm, a procedure where 
a stent graft was placed inside the aneurysm through small 
incisions in your groin. This will prevent the aneurysm from 
rupturing in the future. You are now ready to be discharged home.
Please follow the instructions below:

Take all of your medications as prescribed, unless otherwise 
discussed with your physician.
You may eat a regular diet.
Exercise should be limited to walking; do not lift, push or 
pull anything greater than 10 pounds.
You may shower and wash incisions gently with warm soapy water, 
then pat dry. Do NOT rub or scrub at the incision site.

Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you 
experience any of the following:
 
Severe pain that is not relieved by your medication, or 
changing your position.
New or increasing swelling in your legs, feet, and/or hands.
Fever greater than 101° F for 24 hours or chills.
Any change in your bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation 
or black stools.
Any signs of infection at the site where the catheter was 
inserted (redness, swelling, pain, drainage).
If you are instructed to monitor your temperature and it is 
greater than 101.5° F for 24 hours or greater than 100.5° F for 48 
hours.
Any bleeding from your incision sites or any area on your body.

It was a pleasure taking care of you at St. Catherine Regional Hospital! 

Sincerely,
Your Mclean Surgical Team

Dear Ms. Jensen,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your recent 
hospitalization at the Woodland Medical Center. You were 
admitted for shortness of breath and found to have atrial 
fibrillation, which is an abnormal heart rhythm. We treated 
this with medications called metoprolol and diltiazem.

We also evaluated your kidneys and it appears that they are 
still functioning at a level where you do not need dialysis.
However, we recommend that you follow up closely with your 
nephrologist in the next few weeks to monitor for any signs of 
deterioration in kidney function. 

In addition, we have arranged for you to see a cardiologist 
here at Woodland Medical Center. This doctor will help us 
better understand the cause of your atrial fibrillation and 
develop a plan to prevent it from happening again in the future.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your Hart Care Team

Dear Mr. Slade, 
 
It was a pleasure taking care of you at West Garyton Regional Hospital.  You were 
admitted for depression that had become dangerous because you 
were having thoughts of harming yourself. These symptoms have 
been improving with your medications and we feel that you are 
now safe to return home with your family to continue your 
recovery. 
 
We made some changes to your medications: We started quetiapine 
(Seroquel) for your psychosis, which is the part of your illness 
that makes you hear voices or see things that others do not see.  
We also stopped your gabapentin (Neurontin).  Please follow up 
with Dr. Julianne Sloane at West Garyton Regional Hospital. and 
your other doctors as scheduled. 
 
Please call us if you have any questions or concerns, or if you 
feel that you are becoming too depressed to take care of 
yourself. 
 
We wish you the best in your recovery.

Sincerely,
West Garyton Regional Hospital. Medical Group

Dear Ms. Marquez,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Lincoln Park Community Hospital. 
You came in because you were having chest pain, shortness of breath, 
and lightheadedness after your physical activity. You had an EKG 
which showed that there might have been a heart attack. To further 
evaluate this, we performed a cardiac catheterization which revealed 
a clot in the main artery supplying blood to your left ventricle. We 
also found blockage in several of your smaller coronary arteries.

During your hospital course you also had a echocardiogram that showed 
that there was no damage to your heart from this event, and that it 
is pumping well. You were started on aspirin and metoprolol for 
long-term management of your chest pain and shortness of breath.
We would like to repeat the cardiac catheterization to further assess 
the blockage in your coronary arteries.

Please make sure you follow up with all of your appointments as 
listed below.

It was a pleasure taking care of you,
Your Jones Team

Dear Mr. Blackwood,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your admission to the 
Neurology Service at Harborview Medical Center.  You were 
admitted after having sudden weakness on the right side of 
your body and slurred speech.  Imaging studies revealed that 
you had a hemorrhagic stroke, which is bleeding in the brain.  
Fortunately, there was no further worsening of your symptoms and 
the neurology team determined that you did not need any further 
surgery to remove blood from the brain.

While you were here, your neurological exam showed improvement 
and we are pleased with your progress.  We recommend that you 
continue taking all of your medications as prescribed. You will 
also benefit from a diet low in salt and fat.
 
Followup Instructions:
Please schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel in 2 weeks to monitor your progress and adjust treatment plan as needed, or sooner if you experience any worsening symptoms such as increased weakness or numbness on one side of your body.

Dear Ms. Jensen,

You were admitted to the hospital after your heart 
monitor showed signs that you had a small heart attack. You did 
not have chest pain or shortness of breath during this time, and 
your blood tests confirmed that there was damage to the muscle 
of your heart.

During your stay, we performed an angiogram which showed two of 
the arteries in your heart were partially blocked. These two 
vessels are the circumflex artery and the obtuse marginal artery. 

We placed a stent in these vessels to open them back up so that 
blood can continue to flow through the heart.

You will be on medications for the next 12 months. You should 
take Aspirin, Plavix, Metoprolol tartrate, Losartan, Atorvastatin, 
Omeprazole and Glipizide XL as prescribed.
You should follow up with your primary care doctor and 
cardiologist as scheduled.

We wish you the best,
Your Rodriguez team

to the hospital for testing related to difficulty swallowing 
(food getting stuck in your throat).  In the hospital we did an 
endoscopy (a scope that goes into your mouth and then down into 
your esophagus) which showed no abnormalities, but also some 
abnormal movement of food through your esophagus. You will need a 
24 hour esophageal pH monitoring study to further evaluate this. 

We made the following changes to your medications:
* Start omeprazole 20 mg twice daily
* Continue vitamin E as before

We have scheduled you for the following follow-up appointments:

Esophageal pH monitoring study (24 hours) - please see below 
under ""follow up""
Please call Dr. Julianne Marquez office at Lincoln Community Hospital. to schedule this appointment and confirm the details.
 
Followup Instructions:
Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Marquez in 2 weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as needed based on symptoms and lab results. Please notify her office if any worsening of esophageal dysmotility occurs prior to the scheduled appointment date."
