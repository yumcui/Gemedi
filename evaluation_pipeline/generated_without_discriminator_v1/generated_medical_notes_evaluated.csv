Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Williams, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at Oakwood Community Hospital.  You were admitted 
to the hospital for chest pain.  You had an angiogram performed 
which showed a blockage in one of your coronary arteries.  A 
stent was placed to improve blood flow through this artery.  In 
addition, it appears that you have diabetes mellitus type II.  
This is a chronic condition where your body does not produce 
enough insulin and therefore the cells in your body cannot use 
the glucose from food for energy.

We started you on two new medications to help prevent future 
heart attacks: metoprolol succinate 25mg daily and lisinopril 20mg 
daily.  You will need to continue taking these medications as 
long as you live with the exception of having severe shortness 
of breath where it is not relieved by sitting up or turning your 
head to one side.  Please DO NOT take any NSAIDs, such as 
ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) for at least one month.

We also started you on a medication called metformin which will 
help control the level of sugar in your body.  You can continue 
to take this medication until you run out of your current supply, 
at that time please contact your doctor who can prescribe more.  

In addition to these new medications, we stopped one of your 
medications: sertraline (Zoloft) and we decreased the dose of 
your other medicine:  atenolol from 25mg daily to 0mg daily.
 
Followup Instructions:
Return to see Dr. Rachel Sawyer in 1 week for a follow-up appointment to review your progress and adjust treatment as necessary based on any changes in symptoms or test results. If you experience worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms before then, please contact our office immediately to schedule an urgent visit with Dr. Rachel Sawyer.",0.8873612182543769,0.4,0.6436806091271885

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with a cervical spine fracture 
and T 10 compression fracture. You had a collar placed in the 
ED and you have been wearing it since then. The orthopedic 
surgeons decided that this fracture did not require surgical 
intervention at this time and they are going to follow you as an 
outpatient. You will need to wear your collar until you see them 
again.

You also developed a rash on your arm with erythema, warmth and 
blanching of the skin. The most likely cause is friction from the 
collar. This should improve with time without treatment.

Please return to see Dr. Julianne Patel in 2 weeks for re-evaluation of your cervical spine fracture and T10 compression fracture, as well as to discuss any further treatment or rehabilitation needs you may have at this time.
