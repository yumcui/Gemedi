Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Williams, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at Oakwood Community Hospital.  You were admitted 
to the hospital for chest pain.  You had an angiogram performed 
which showed a blockage in one of your coronary arteries.  A 
stent was placed to improve blood flow through this artery.  In 
addition, it appears that you have diabetes mellitus type II.  
This is a chronic condition where your body does not produce 
enough insulin and therefore the cells in your body cannot use 
the glucose from food for energy.

We started you on two new medications to help prevent future 
heart attacks: metoprolol succinate 25mg daily and lisinopril 20mg 
daily.  You will need to continue taking these medications as 
long as you live with the exception of having severe shortness 
of breath where it is not relieved by sitting up or turning your 
head to one side.  Please DO NOT take any NSAIDs, such as 
ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) for at least one month.

We also started you on a medication called metformin which will 
help control the level of sugar in your body.  You can continue 
to take this medication until you run out of your current supply, 
at that time please contact your doctor who can prescribe more.  

In addition to these new medications, we stopped one of your 
medications: sertraline (Zoloft) and we decreased the dose of 
your other medicine:  atenolol from 25mg daily to 0mg daily.
 
Followup Instructions:
Return to see Dr. Rachel Sawyer in 1 week for a follow-up appointment to review your progress and adjust treatment as necessary based on any changes in symptoms or test results.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with a cervical spine fracture 
and T 10 compression fracture. You had a collar placed in the 
ED and you have been wearing it since then. The orthopedic 
surgeons decided that this fracture did not require surgical 
intervention at this time and they are going to follow you as an 
outpatient. You will need to wear your collar until you see them 
again.

You also developed a rash on your arm with erythema, warmth and 
blanching of the skin. The most likely cause is friction from the 
collar. This should improve with time without treatment.

Dear Mr. Mitchell,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had a 
myocardial infarction (heart attack). You underwent cardiac 
catheterization and a stent was placed in your left anterior 
descending artery, which is one of the main blood vessels that 
supplies oxygenated blood to your heart muscle. The catheter 
procedure went well without complications.

You were transferred to the cardiac floor for further management 
of your chest pain symptoms. You continued to have chest pain 
when you would walk or go up stairs but this resolved within 10-15 
minutes of resting in a chair or bed.

Your heart rate and blood pressure remained stable. There was no 
evidence of a pulmonary embolism on imaging, but we recommend 
that you follow-up with your primary care doctor to get an EKG 
done at the time of your annual physical exam this year.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Smith, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization at Springdale Community Hospital.  You were 
admitted to the hospital because of food getting stuck in 
your throat (dysphagia). You underwent an endoscopy which 
showed that there was a stricture in your esophagus from a burn 
injury many years ago. This is a scar tissue narrowing in the 
esophagus and you will need to have this dilated regularly. 

You were also admitted with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, 
and diarrhea. We did an endoscopy (EGD) of your upper GI tract 
which showed inflammation of the esophagus that was not due to 
an infection like a virus or bacteria. Your symptoms improved 
with fluids and we did not need to treat you further with 
medications.

You will need to follow up with Dr. Julianne Marquez, who is 
your primary care doctor as well as your gastroenterologist 
(GI doctor). You have an appointment with her in two weeks to 
follow-up on the endoscopy and to discuss when you should have 
the stricture dilated again.

We wish you all the best! 

Sincerely, 
Your Carver Care Team

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with chest pain and we found a blockage in one 
of the arteries that brings blood to your heart.  We performed 
a procedure called a cardiac catheterization, which involved 
using a thin tube (called a catheter) to inject dye into the 
arteries of your heart. This allowed us to see the extent of the 
blockages and we found one blockage in your right coronary 
artery that was partially blocking blood flow to your heart.  
We also performed a procedure called an angioplasty, which 
involved using a balloon to open up the blockage in your artery.  
After this procedure, you were monitored overnight with a EKG 
and a monitor attached to your chest and no new signs of damage 
were seen.

You will need to take aspirin and Plavix (Plxy) to prevent blood 
from clotting inside your arteries.  You should also follow up 
with the cardiologist Dr. Julianne Marlowe in the next few days or 
week, as they would like to see you for a check of your heart's 
electrical activity.

It is important that you continue to take care of yourself after 
this event by eating well and continuing to exercise regularly. 
 
Followup Instructions:
Return to see Dr. Julianne Marlowe in 1 week for re-evaluation of your coronary artery disease and to discuss further management options, or sooner if you experience any worsening symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath. Be sure to inform her office staff of your need for urgent follow-up upon scheduling your appointment. Regular monitoring by Dr. Julianne Marlowe will help ensure that your condition continues to improve and that any necessary adjustments are made to your treatment plan.",0.9692203128380843,0.4,0.6846101564190421,No issues found

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Fothergill,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission to 
the hospital.  You were admitted for shortness of breath and low 
blood pressure. We felt that this was due to the heart not 
pumping well, which is concerning given your history of heart 
disease and prior heart attack. The echocardiogram showed that 
your left ventricle has decreased pumping function, but it did 
not show any evidence for a significant blockage in one of the 
heart's blood vessels.

In order to help you better tolerate activities while at home, 
we have started you on an ACE inhibitor (Losartan) and beta 
blocker (Metoprolol Succinate XL). These medications are very 
important in helping your heart function well. We also want to 
make sure that your blood pressure does not become too low when 
you are at home.

We made a change to your medications while you were here in the 
hospital. Please stop taking Amlodipine (Norvasc) and start 
taking Losartan 100 mg once daily. Also, please take Metoprolol 
Succinate XL 50mg once daily. 

While you are recovering at home, it is very important that you 
do not smoke or be around others who are smoking. It is also very 
important to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.

Please follow up with your primary care physician and 
cardiologist as scheduled below.

Dear Ms. Jensen,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the Rodriguez.  You were 
admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting 
and weight loss.  On further evaluation, we determined that your 
pain is most likely due to a tumor in the stomach and pancreas.

being prepared for surgery to relieve the obstruction in your 
stomach.

Please follow up with your oncologist as an outpatient, and 
continue all of your home medications unless otherwise instructed 
by your doctor.  You may also use any over the counter medication 
that you find comfortable for pain control.  

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Jensen,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization 
at Bayshore Medical Center.  You were admitted to the Surgery 
service after having abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for 
several days. An ultrasound of your abdomen showed that you have 
a condition called diverticulitis which is an inflammation of 
your colon. This most likely occurred due to a blockage in one 
of the small pouches in your intestine. In order to make sure this 
does not get worse, we are sending you home with antibiotics and 
to follow up with your surgeon who will monitor you for signs of 
infection or other complications.

Your abdominal pain improved while you were here and you have 
been tolerating a regular diet. We recommend that you continue 
to eat small frequent meals to decrease the discomfort from 
abdominal distension. If your symptoms worsen, please seek care 
from your primary physician or return to the emergency room if 
you believe your condition is life threatening.

Please follow up with your surgeon in one week for a post op 
visit and as you will be discharged on antibiotics, this visit is 
important so that we can assess whether further treatment is 
required. We also recommend that you continue to take your other 
medications as prescribed by your physicians prior to coming to 
the hospital.

Please seek medical attention if you develop any of the signs 
and symptoms listed below:
* severe abdominal pain
* vomiting and inability to keep down fluids or food
* fevers greater than 101 degrees
* chills
* blood in stool
* chest pain

Thank you for allowing us to be a part of your care,
Your Bayshore Medical Center Team

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Rylan, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Johnsonland Regional Hospital.  You were admitted 
for diarrhea. Your stool cultures showed no evidence of bacterial or parasitic 
infection. Your CT scan did not show any signs of infection in the intestines. 
You had a colonoscopy which showed that your small intestine is connected to 
your colon (a condition called short gut). This will cause chronic diarrhea and 
you should follow up with your gastroenterologist regularly to make sure this 
does not worsen. 

In addition, you have a new rash on the back of your legs that is concerning for 
shingles, so please follow up with your primary care doctor.

Please continue to take all of your medications as prescribed and keep all of 
your scheduled appointments. 

Sincerely,

Your Davisland Regional Hospital Team

Dear Ms. Wilder, 

It was a pleasure taking part in your care at Lincoln Regional Hospital.  

You were admitted to the hospital with a right hand fracture.  
Your hand x-rays showed a fracture of two bones in your wrist and 
two small bones in your fingers called metacarpals.  The orthopedic 
surgeons felt that your fractures could be treated non-operatively 
without surgery.  They recommend that you keep your arm at rest, 
keep it elevated to decrease swelling and use ice packs every 
four hours as needed for pain or discomfort.  Please avoid any 
activities that may worsen the swelling of your hand.  

You will need to follow up with an orthopedic surgeon at Lincoln Regional Hospital.  Dr. Julianne Marquez have made you an appointment with Dr. Julianne Marquez on Brown, please keep this 
appointment so that we can remove the splint and start you on a 
course of physical therapy. 

If there is anything else we can do for you, or if you have any 
questions, please don't hesitate to call your doctor or nurse 
practitioner.

We wish you all the best in your recovery!

Sincerely,
Your Medical Team at Lincoln Regional Hospital

Dear Ms. Marquez,

It was a pleasure caring for you at South Chrisman Medical Center.  
You were admitted to the hospital after having chest pain.  
During your stay, we performed tests to find out why you had 
your chest pain. These tests showed that one of your arteries is 
partially blocked and this is most likely the reason for your 
chest pain. We started you on medication called metoprolol to 
help reduce the amount of blood flow through this artery when it 
is constricted.

You will be following up with your outpatient cardiologist, Dr. Julianne Sloane, 
who will determine if you need further testing or intervention 
with one of the interventional cardiologists at South Chrisman Medical Center.  

Please call your doctor or return to the emergency department if 
you have any shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, 
lightheadedness, dizziness, or any other symptoms that are of 
concern to you.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care,
Your Cardiology Team

Dear Mr. Wilson,
 
You were admitted to the pediatric service at North Michael

is a cyst that forms behind your knee.  The cyst is a fluid 
collection.  Sometimes this can be drained with a needle.

here.
 
We also do not think you need to follow up in the Levine clinic 
after discharge, but please call your primary care physician 
to make an appointment for further evaluation of your blood 
pressure and cholesterol levels.
 
Please take all medications as prescribed.  We have given you 
a prescription for oxycodone, which is a narcotic pain reliever.  
Please do not drive while taking this medication or any other 
narcotic pain relievers.

We wish you the best of health,
Your North Michael Community Hospital Team

INSTRUCTIONS AFTER SPINE SURGERY

- You were in the hospital for 1 day after your surgery. This is 
a normal amount of time for this type of procedure. 

- Please call the office if you experience any numbness, 
tingling, weakness, loss of reflexes, or bowel/bladder dysfunction 
in your lower extremities.

- Avoid heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, or bending for 6 weeks 
as this can put additional stress on your spine and the surgical 
site.

water run over your incision; do not use a shower head to spray 
the area.

- Do not take any anti-inflammatory medication such as Motrin, 
Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Advil, Aleve, or Nuprin for at least 4 weeks 
as this can further irritate the spine and surgical site. 

- You may start driving when you feel comfortable and able to do 
so, but no driving while taking narcotics.

- Resume your home medications unless otherwise instructed.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for an ovarian cyst. This was 
removed surgically and sent to pathology, which did not show any 
cancer cells in it. You tolerated this surgery well without any 
complications. 

You are now ready to be discharged home with the following 
instructions:

Do not drive until you are no longer taking pain medications.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any narcotics 
(pain relievers such as oxycodone, percocet, vicodin) for 2 weeks 
after surgery. You may use over the counter pain medication like 
Tylenol or ibuprofen if needed.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber to prevent constipation
You should not eat constipating foods such as cheese, dairy, 
milk, ice cream, bread, pasta, beef, pork for 4-6 weeks after 
surgery. You may have small amounts of these foods but they are 
not good for you right now.
You may shower and wash incisions gently with warm soapy water. 
Rinse clean and pat dry. You may apply a thin layer of Vaseline or
Aquaphor with gauze over the incision. Change this dressing daily 
if it is open, otherwise change every other day. 
Do not soak your incisions in a bath or pool for at least 4-6 
weeks after surgery.
You may have a light headed feeling when standing or walking due 
to the anesthesia given during surgery. This will improve over 
time and you will get used to it. If you feel faint, sit down or 
lay down and put your feet up, drink some water and take slow 
deep breaths. 
You may experience fatigue (feeling tired) for a few weeks after 
surgery. You should try to walk several times per day for 10-15 
minutes.
Your appetite will be decreased immediately after surgery but 
will improve with time. Try small frequent meals and snacks. It 
is normal for your bowel movements to be slow at first and they 
will return to normal within a few weeks. If you have severe 
diarrhea or blood in the stool,",0.9543097512246748,0.35,0.6521548756123374,Structure: Missing required keywords
