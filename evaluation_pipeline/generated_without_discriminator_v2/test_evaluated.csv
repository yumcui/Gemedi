Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Wellesley,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission to 
Fulton Community Hospital.  You were admitted with headache, 
nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbance.  Your symptoms were 
likely due to migraine headaches.  We started you on IV fluids 
and pain medication without improvement in your headache.  You 
were evaluated by neurology who felt that your headache was most 
consistent with a migraine headache.  We also performed an MRI of 
your brain which showed no evidence of stroke or other acute 
process.

We made the following changes to your medications:
- Started Aspirin 81mg daily
- Started Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg daily

Please continue to take all of your home medications as 
prescribed.  Please DO NOT restart any blood pressure or heart 
medications until you see your primary care doctor in the next 
few weeks.  We are not sure what dose is appropriate for you at 
this time.

Please follow up with neurology on an outpatient basis within 4 
weeks.  Please also schedule a follow-up appointment with your 
primary care physician within the next few weeks to discuss 
restarting some of your blood pressure and heart medications.

Thank you again for allowing us to participate in your care.
-Your Fletcher Community Hospital Team
