To treat \nthese conditions, we recommend that you start by seeing a \ncardiologist at New Laceyland General Hospital. - you can contact Hunter to get \nthis appointment set up.  Secondly, we will be starting you on a \ncouple of medications for your heart.  For your low vitamin \nlevels, you will need to start taking injections of B12 as \ndescribed below, as well as taking daily iron pills.  We also \nmade some changes to your diabetes pills (your sugars were too \nlow and we wanted to reduce some of your diabetes medications). \n.\nYour medication changes are summarized as below:\nSTOP actos - this can make your heart disease worse\nSTOP Glimepiride - this may have led to your low sugars\n\n->START amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day for a urinary tract \ninfection for an additional 4 days. \n->START vitamin B12 injections daily (this will be arranged with \nyour primary care doctor, please speak to your PCP about this)\n->START metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day - this is for your heart\n->START losartan 25 mg daily - this is also for your heart\n->START aspirin 81 mg daily - this helps prevent the future risk \nof heart attack\n->START ferrous sulfate - this is for replenishing your iron\n\n-> CHANGE lantus to 20 units in the morning; you should continue \nyour metformin as normal.    \n \nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Kessler in 3 weeks to monitor the progression of your dilated cardiomyopathy and adjust treatment as necessary. During this visit, Dr. Kessler will review your medication regimen and perform any additional tests or examinations deemed necessary for your ongoing care."}

You were admitted to the hospital after \nadjustment of a previously placed stent graft in your aorta to \nstrengthen the part of the artery that was weakened by an \naneurysm.  To perform this procedure, small punctures were made \nin the arteries on both sides of your groin. You tolerated the \nprocedure well and are now ready to be discharged from the \nhospital. Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a \nspeedy and uneventful recovery.\n\nDivision of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery\nEndovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair Discharge \nInstructions\n\nPLEASE NOTE: After endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), it is very \nimportant to have regular appointments (every Ponce months) for \nthe rest of your life.  These appointments will include a CT \n(CAT) scan and/or ultrasound of your graft.  If you miss an \nappointment, please call to reschedule. \n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:\n Bruising, tenderness, and a sensation of fullness at the groin \npuncture sites (or incisions) is normal and will go away in \none-two weeks\n\nCARE OF THE GROIN PUNCTURE SITES:\n It is normal to have mild swelling, a small bruise, or small \namounts of drainage at the groin puncture sites.  In two weeks, \nyou may feel a small, painless, pea sized knot at the puncture \nsites.  This too is normal.  Male patients may notice swelling \nin the scrotum.  The swelling will get better over one-two \nweeks.\n Look at the area daily to see if there are any changes.  Be \nsure to report signs of infection.  These include: increasing \nredness; worsening pain; new or increasing drainage, or drainage \nthat is white, yellow, or green; or fever of 101.5 or more.  (If \nyou have taken aspirin, Tylenol, or other fever reducing \nmedicine, wait at least Walker hours after taking it before you \ncheck your temperature in order to get an accurate reading.)\n\nFOR SUDDEN, SEVERE BLEEDING OR SWELLING (Groin puncture site or \nincision)\n If you have sudden, severe bleeding or swelling at either of \nthe groin puncture sites: \n-Lie down, keep leg straight and apply (or have someone apply) \nfirm pressure to area for Cunningham minutes with a gauze pad or \nclean cloth. \n-Once bleeding has stopped, call your surgeon to report what \nhappened.   \n-If bleeding does not stop, call Zuniga for transfer to closest \nEmergency Room. \n You may shower 48 hours after surgery.  Let the soapy water \nrun over the puncture sites, then rinse and pat dry.  Do not rub \nthese sites and do not apply cream, lotion, ointment or powder. \n Wear loose-fitting pants and clothing as this will be less \nirritating to the groin puncture sites. \n\nMEDICATIONS\n Take aspirin daily. Aspirin helps prevent blood clots that \ncould form in your repaired artery. \n It is very important that you never stop taking aspirin or \nother blood thinning medicines-even for a short while- unless \nthe surgeon who repaired your aneurysm tells you it is okay to \nstop.   Do not stop taking them, even if another doctor or nurse \ntells you to, without getting an okay from the surgeon who first \nprescribed them. \n You will be given prescriptions for any new medication started \nduring your hospital stay.\n Before you go home, your nurse Taylor give you information about \nnew medication and will review all the medications you should \ntake at home.  Be sure to ask any questions you may have.  If \nsomething you normally take or may take is not on the list you \nreceive from the nurse, please ask if it is okay to take it.\n \nPAIN MANAGEMENT\n Most patients do not have much pain following this procedure.  \n Your puncture sites may be a little sore.  This will improve \ndaily. If it is getting worse, please let us know.\nYou will be given instructions about taking pain medicine if \nyou need it.\n\nACTIVITY\n You must limit activity to protect the puncture sites in your \ngroin.  For ONE WEEK:\n-Do not drive\n-Do not swim, take a tub bath or go in a Jacuzzi or hot tub\n-Do not lift, push, pull or carry anything heavier than five \npounds\n-Do not do any exercise or activity that causes you to hold your \nbreath or bear down with your abdominal muscles.\n-Do not resume sexual activity\n Discuss with your surgeon when you may return to other regular \nactivities, including work.  If needed, we will give you a \nletter for your workplace. \n It is normal to feel weak and tired.  This can last six-eight \nweeks, but should get better day by day. You may want to have \nhelp around the house during this time.\n Mcgee push yourself too hard during your recovery.  Rest when \nyou feel tired.  Gradually return to normal activities over the \nnext month.\n We encourage you to walk regularly. Walking, especially \noutdoors in good weather is the best exercise for circulation.  \nWalk short distances at first, even in the house, then do a \nlittle more each day.\n It is okay to climb stairs.  You may need to climb them slowly \nand pause after every few steps. \n\nDIET\n It is normal to have a decreased appetite.  Your appetite will \nreturn over time.\n Follow a well balance, heart-healthy diet, with moderate \nrestriction of salt and fat. \n Eat small, frequent meals with nutritious food options (high \nfiber, lean meats, fruits, and vegetables) to maintain your \nstrength and to help with wound healing.\n\nBOWEL AND BLADDER FUNCTION\n You should be able to pass urine without difficulty.  Call you \ndoctor if you have any problems urinating, such as burning, \npain, bleeding, going too often, or having trouble urinating or \nstarting the flow of urine.   Call if you have a decrease in the \namount of urine. \n You may experience some constipation after surgery because of \npain medicine and changes in activity.  Increasing fluids and \nfiber in your diet and staying active can help.  To relief \nconstipation, you may talk a mild laxative.   Please take to \nyour pharmacist for advice about what to take. \n\nSMOKING\n If you smoke, it is very important that you STOP. Research \nshows smoking makes vascular disease worse. This could increase \nthe chance of a blockage in your new graft.  Talk to your \nprimary care physician about ways to quit smoking. \n\nCALLING FOR HELP/DANGER SIGNS\nIf you need help, please call us at Rosalesshire Medical Center.   Remember, \nyour doctor, or someone covering for your doctor, is available \n24 hours a day, seven days a week.   If you call during \nnonbusiness hours, you will reach someone who can help you reach \nthe vascular surgeon on call. \n\nCall your surgeon right away for:\n Pain in the groin area that is not relieved with medication, \nor pain that is getting worse instead of better\n Increased redness at the groin puncture sites\n New or increased drainage from the groin puncture sites, or \nwhite yellow, or green drainage \n Any new bleeding from the groin puncture sites.  For sudden, \nsevere bleeding, apply pressure for Young minutes. If the \nbleeding stops, call your doctor right away to report what \nhappened.  If it does not stop, call Haas\n Fever greater than 101.5 degrees\n Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea or constipation\n Any worsening pain in your abdomen\n Problems with urination\n Changes in color or sensation in your feet or legs \n\nCALL Jackson in an EMERGENCY, such as\n Any sudden, severe pain in the back, abdomen, or chest\n A sudden change in ability to move or use your legs\n Sudden, severe bleeding or swelling at either groin site that \ndoes not stop after applying pressure for Mcclure minutes\n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Aaron Miles in 4 weeks to monitor the sac size and determine if further intervention is necessary due to persistent endoleak and sac expansion despite prior EVAR. You should also schedule an appointment with his office if you experience any new symptoms or worsening of existing symptoms at any time before your scheduled follow-up visit."}

An ultrasound of the \nheart (echocardiogram) showed that your heart does not pump as \nhard as it should, a condition called \"systolic heart failure\". \nA procedure called an cardiac catheterization was performed to \nlook at the blood vessels that supply the heart, as blockages to \nthese arteries can cause this condition. Your cardiac \ncatheterization showed clean blood vessels, which leads us to \nbelieve your systolic heart failure may be due to your heavy \nalcohol use. \n\nWe have started you on several medications to protect your heart \nand help it beat stronger, but the most important thing you can \ndo for this condition is to stop drinking alcohol. Please ask \nyour primary care doctor about resources to help you do this. \n**Continuing to drink could be dangerous to your health and even \nfatal**\n\nDrinking too much alcohol also puts you at risk for vitamin \ndeficiences, so we recommend that you start taking folate and \nthiamine, two vitamins now included in your medication list. \n\nYour heart condition puts you at risk for having excess fluid \nbuild up in your lungs and legs. Please weigh yourself every \nmorning and call your doctor if your weight increases by more \nthan 3 pounds in 5 days. You should also keep a low sodium diet \n(less than 2g or 2000mg per day) and try to drink only 1.5L or \n50 ounces of fluids a day.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Cody Stanley in 2 weeks for a re-evaluation of your cardiac function and to assess the effectiveness of any prescribed treatments for suspected alcoholic cardiomyopathy."}

Please \nmake sure to eat frequent meals throughout the day.\n\nDuring this admission you also complained of abdominal pain and \ndizziness when you have not eaten a meal. Given your history of \ngastric ulcers, these symptoms are likely caused by acid reflux \nand stomach inflammation.

Please follow up with your \nprimary care doctor as you may need further outpatient \nprocedures to evaluate this stomach inflammation. \n \nFollowup Instructions:\nSchedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Diane Garcia in 4-6 weeks to assess the effectiveness of current treatment and monitor for any further gastrointestinal symptoms.

Because you had a recent GI bleed when \nyou were on blood thinners (Pradaxa) for your atrial \nfibrillation, we placed a removable filter (IVC filter) in the \nvein leading to your heart to protect you from a clot entering \nthe lungs (pulmonary embolus).  This filter is temporary and \nshould be removed in 3 months.  You have expressed interest in \ntransferring your cardiology care to the Saunders, so we set up a \nfollow up appointment with a cardiologist here (below) who will \nremove the filter in the future and help decide whether or not \nyou will need blood thinners in the future for your atrial \nfibrillation.  \n \nWe also reviewed the records from Becker from the \ngastroenterologists who performed the colonoscopy, endoscopy, \nand capsule study.  You should follow up with your PCP to get Taylor \nreferral for a GI appointment at the Davis so they can explore \nthe possibility of additional studies to find the source of \nbleeding.  \n \nYou also have to get a referral from your PCP to get Burton follow up \nappointment for a hematologist here (Dr. John Campos or \ncolleagues) who will discuss possible blood testing to determine \nwhy you formed a clot in your leg. It is unclear why you formed \na clot in your leg, this could be due to your recent \nhospitalization, but it could also be due to low level \ninflammation which could be from a variety of causes such as \ninfection or a cancer. You could also be at a genetically higher \nrisk of forming clots. \n \nIt was a pleasure taking care of you. \n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. John Campos in 2 weeks for a re-evaluation of your left gastroc DVT to assess the effectiveness of your current treatment plan and make any necessary adjustments."}
