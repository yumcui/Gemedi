The fluid usually occurs at the site of the anal \nglands that we all have. The fluid can become infected and \nrequire drainage.\nOnce they are drained, they start to feel better very quickly. \nMost heal completely. Thirty to fifty percent of abscesses \neither fail to heal over the next Stewart weeks or recur at some \npoint in your lifetime. The gland that started the infection may \nform a fistula, which is a small tunnel connecting the anal \ngland to the skin of the buttocks outside the anus. Keeping your \nfollow-up appointment is important because it allows us to \ndetermine if you develop a fistula.\n\nWound Care\nYou have a malecot drain that is sutured securely on your \nbuttocks in order to drain the abscess. This drain should be \nflushed every day for hygiene. \n\nThe dressings that are in place may be removed the following \nmorning or at the first bowel movement. Any packing can be \nremoved at that time or while sitting in the tub. You should \nexpect bloody, foul drainage for several days. This is not a \nsterile area, and no fancy dressings are required. Dressings \nmostly act to prevent staining of your undergarments. Feminine \nmini Fischer pads may be easiest to use, and simple gauze pads \nare also OK. Limiting the use of tape may aid in your comfort.\n\nYou should begin warm soaks in the bathtub Ramos tub after you \nremove the packing. These soaks may be helpful at relaxing the \nanal muscle spasms and thus decrease your pain. They may be done \nfor Briggs minutes at a time up to every four hours, but at least \ntwice per day.\nThe warm soaks also allow for irrigation of the abscess cavity, \nwhich will help speed healing. When in the tub, gentle finger \npressure can be applied to the skin around the abscess opening \nto make sure that it is still completely drained.\n\nCleansing after bowel movements must be performed gently. Baby \nwipes can be helpful at getting clean with little trauma. \nFlushable adult wipes are also available.\nAvoid any medicated wipes as these may contain witch Mcclain or \nalcohol. They will cause discomfort. Wiping can be avoided all \ntogether if one goes directly to the warm soaks after a bowel \nmovement. Nothing needs to be added to the water. Bubbles, oils, \nor Epsom salts may be added if this improves your comfort or \nsense of cleaning. The water should not be so hot as to risk a \nburn injury.\n\nBowel Regimen\nIt is often difficult to move your bowels after anal surgery. \nPain and narcotic pain medications are constipating. It is \nimportant to keep the bowels moving. The stool only becomes \nharder if you do not move them for days. You should eat a \nregular healthy diet.\nYou should take an over-the counter stool softener (Colace \n[sodium docusate] 100 mg twice daily or Surfak [docusate \ncalcium] 240 mg once daily) to keep the stools soft. It must be \ntaken with Simmons glasses of liquid throughout the day. You should \nalso take one teaspoon dose of a fiber supplement (psyllium, \nMetamucil, Citrucel, Benefiber) daily to keep the bowels soft \nand moving. Fluids are also required for these to help. Gentle \nstimulant laxatives (milk of magnesia, dulcolax, senna) should \nbe taken only if you have not moved your bowels for one or two \ndays.\n\nAt times, all three of these (stool softener, fiber, and \nlaxative) may be required to help the bowels. It is important \nnot to take so much that you have diarrhea.\nActivity No driving or working until off narcotic pain \nmedications. Otherwise, you may return to work when you feel \nthat you are able. Avoid activity that can cause direct trauma \nto the area. Your activity is limited mostly by your discomfort.\nPain Medication Pain should improve every day after the drainage \nof the abscess. No pains should be getting worse. Increased pain \nat the time of bowel movements is expected. Pain can be \ncontrolled with Tylenol, ibuprofen, or a prescription pain \nmedication. No topical ointments or topical antibiotics are \nrequired. If you were given a prescription for antibiotic pills, \nplease take them as directed.\n\nNOTIFY THE DOCTOR IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING OCCUR:\nFever greater than 101 degrees, swelling in the area, or \nincreased pain, as these can be signs of infection. Heavy \ndrainage is common from these wounds.\nInability to move your bowels despite the previous laxative \nrecommendation\nInability to urinate. Pain and surgery can make it hard to void. \nSometimes sitting in warm soaks helps to get started.\nHeavy bleeding.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Julianne Patel in 2 weeks for a post-operative check to assess the healing of the perirectal abscess and remove any sutures or staples as needed."}

You were started on new \nmedications to treat your blood pressure and your blood pressure \nimproved.\n\nWHAT SHOULD YOU DO AT HOME?\nYou should continue the new medications for your seizures and \nblood pressure and follow up with the surgeons and neurologist \nat your next scheduled appointment. You also have a primary care \nphysician appointment scheduled for you to follow up and \nestablish care. You will have to discuss with the new PCP about \ncardiologist referral for your peripheral vascular disease that \nwas treated with aspirin, Plavix, and procedures in your lower \nextremity arteries in Elliott last year. As you know, your \nPlavix was stopped due to GI bleeding that occurred in Robinson \nlast year. You need a new cardiologist to continue to manage \nyour antiplatelet agents.\n\nBecause you had a seizure, please do not drive a car until you \nare cleared by your Neurologist. \n\nPlease work on switching your insurance to Lyons so that \nyou can continue to get care here. \n\nThank you for allowing us be involved in your care, we wish you \nall the best!\n\nYour East Jamestown Regional Hospital Team\n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nSchedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel in 1 week to assess the efficacy of the current treatment plan and make any necessary adjustments.

You were admitted to the hospital with right \nleg pain that we found was secondary to a blockage in your \nbypass graft. We also noted a clot in a vein in your calf.  We \ndid a peripheral angiogram to open up the graft with special \ncatheter and balloons.   To do the procedure, a small puncture \nwas made in one of your arteries.  The puncture site heals on \nits own: there are no stitches to remove.   You tolerated the \nprocedure well and are now ready to be discharged from the \nhospital.   Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a \nspeedy and uneventful recovery.\n\nPeripheral Angiography\nPuncture Site Care\nFor one week:\nDo not take a tub bath, go swimming or use a Jacuzzi or hot \ntub.\nUse only mild soap and water to gently clean the area around \nthe puncture site. \nGently pat the puncture site dry after showering. \nDo not use powders, lotions, or ointments in the area of the \npuncture site. \n\nYou may remove the bandage and shower the day after the \nprocedure.  You may leave the bandage off. \nYou may have a small bruise around the puncture site.  This is \nnormal and will go away one-two weeks. \nActivity \nFor the first 48 hours: \nDo not drive for 48 hours after the procedure\nFor the first week:\nDo not lift, push , pull or carry anything heavier than 10 \npounds\nDo not do any exercises or activity that causes you to hold \nyour breath or bear down with abdominal muscles.   Take care not \nto put strain on your abdominal muscles when coughing, sneezing, \nor moving your bowels.\nAfter one week:\nYou may go back to all your regular activities, including \nsexual activity.  We suggest you begin your exercise program at \nhalf of your usual routine for the first few days.   You may \nthen gradually work back to your full routine.\nMedications:\nBefore you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all \nthe medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you \nnormally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not \ntake is on the list please discuss it with the team!  \n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nSchedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. David Riggs in 1-2 weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as necessary for optimal management of Peripheral Arterial Disease."}

This caused nausea/vomiting and \nheadache and damage to your brain called posterior reversible \nleukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES) on your Brain MRI. You also \nhad multiple small strokes scattered throughout your brain on a \nrepeat brain MRI. You initially required intubation for trouble \nbreathing. You were transferred to one of our ICUs from another \nhospital for further management after it became difficult to \nextubate you. On admission, you had right sided weakness that \nimproved over time. You were ultimately extubated and could \nbreath on your own. Your blood pressure required multiple \nmedications for management throughout the admission but we \neventually kept your blood pressure controlled between \nHampton on multiple blood pressure medications. You had a \nlow red blood cell count (anemia) during the admission which we \nthought was likely because of the stress placed on your body \n(anemia of chronic disease). You had a scope of your upper and \nlower gut to look for other sources of bleeds but these were \nnormal. You had a bacterial infection Marshall your blood and a \npneumonia that required treatment with IV Vancomycin and IV \nZosyn for 12 days. Your kidneys also showed damage from your \nlikely long standing high blood pressure. Our renal service \nevaluated you and a kidney biopsy was done to confirm this \ndiagnosis. \nYou have been evaluated by our physical therapists. They \nrecommend discharge home with home physical therapy.\nPetersen addition to the follow up appointments listed below, you will \nalso require follow-up with a neurologist. Please obtain a \nreferral from your primary care doctor.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Julianne Marquez in 2 weeks for re-evaluation and to review laboratory results, or sooner if symptoms of PRES worsen or do not improve as expected."}

Fortunately, by the time you were brought up \nto the Ashley hospital floors, the site was not leaking \nanymore, so we watched the site closely but did not need to do \nany further treatment. \n-We used special imaging techniques to look for pockets of fluid \nin your belly, we found a small pocket of fluid which was \nsampled. The sample did not show any signs of bacteria growing \nat the time of your discharge. \n\nWhat should I do when I leave the hospital?  \n- You should follow-up with your outpatient providers as \nscheduled. \n- You should take your medications as prescribed for the \nduration of time specified on the prescription, including the \nnew antibiotic medication to treat your urinary tract infection \n(CIPROFLOXACIN), as well as the new medication to help you avoid \nfurther episodes of confusion by removing out more of the \ncontributing toxins (LACTULOSE)\n- You should watch for new/or worsening symptoms, especially \nthose listed below in the section entitled \"Danger Signs\". If \nyou do not feel like you are getting better or have any other \nconcerns, please call your doctor to discuss or return to the \nemergency room.  \n\nSincerely,  \n\nYour Stephens Care Team  \n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Julianne Marston in 3 days to review lab results and discuss further management of primary diagnosis, or sooner if symptoms worsen.

Smith may or may not \nhave had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is \nacceptable, however it is important that Sarahview General Hospital. have a bowel \nmovement in the next Pierce days. After anesthesia it is not \nuncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function \nbut Hickman should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool \nand passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are \nexpected. However, if Russell notice that Sarahview General Hospital. are passing bright red \nblood with bowel movements or having loose stool without \nimprovement please call the office or go to the emergency room \nif the symptoms are severe. If Donovan are taking narcotic pain \nmedications there is a risk that Sarahview General Hospital. will have some \nconstipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener \nsuch as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the \noffice. If Johns have any of the following symptoms please call \nthe office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: \nincreasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, \nnausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, \nprolonged loose stool, or extended constipation.  \n \nWoods have Gonzalez laparoscopic surgical incisions on your abdomen \nwhich are closed with internal sutures and a skin glue called \nDermabond. These are healing well however it is important that Sarahview General Hospital. monitor these areas for signs and symptoms of infection \nincluding: increasing redness of the incision lines, \nwhite/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, increased pain at the \nincision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, or \nswelling of the area. Please call the office if Maynard develop any \nof these symptoms or a fever. Morris may go to the emergency room \nif your symptoms are severe.  \nBrewer may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. \nThe small incisions may be left open to the air. If closed with \nsteri-strips (little white adhesive strips) instead of \nDermabond, these will fall off over time, please do not remove \nthem. Please no baths or swimming for 6 weeks after surgery \nunless told otherwise by your surgical team.\n \nVelez will be prescribed narcotic pain medication. This medication \nshould be taken when Davis have pain and as needed as written on \nthe bottle. This is not a standing medication. Andrews should \ncontinue to take Tylenol for pain around the clock and Nichols can \nalso take Advil. Please do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol \nin 14 hours. Do not drink alcohol while taking narcotic pain \nmedication or Tylenol. Please do not drive a car while taking \nnarcotic pain medication.\n\n  \nNo heavy lifting greater than 6 lbs for until your first \npost-operative visit after surgery. Please no strenuous activity \nuntil this time unless instructed otherwise.  \n \nThank Sharp for allowing us to participate in your care! Our hope \nis that Sarahview General Hospital. will have a quick return to your life and usual \nactivities. Good luck!  \n \n\nZuniga have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a \nnew ileostomy placement is dehydration. The output from the \nstoma is stool from the small intestine and the water content is \nvery high. The stool is no longer passing through the large \nintestine which is where the water from the stool is reabsorbed \ninto the body and the stool becomes formed. Gentry must measure \nyour ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output from \nthe stoma should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If \nThompson find that your output has become too much or too little, \nplease call the office for advice. The office nurse or nurse \npractitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the \nileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if Khan notice \nyour ileostomy output increasing, take in more electrolyte drink \nsuch as Gatorade. Please monitor yourself for signs and symptoms \nof dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon standing), \nweakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue. If Thompson notice these \nsymptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room \nfor evaluation if these symptoms are severe. Gillespie may eat a \nregular diet with your new ileostomy. However it is a good idea \nto avoid fatty or spicy foods and follow diet suggestions made \nto Osborn by the ostomy nurses.  \n \nPlease monitor the appearance of the ostomy and stoma and care \nfor it as instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. Sanders stoma \n(intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be \nbeefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times \nwhen touched and this should subside with time. The skin around \nthe ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the \nskin around the stoma for bulging or signs of infection listed \nabove. Please care for the ostomy as Simpson have been instructed by \nthe wound/ostomy nurses. Zuniga will be able to make an appointment \nwith the ostomy nurse in the clinic 7 days after surgery. Hayden \nwill have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks \nhelping to monitor your ostomy until Howe are comfortable caring \nfor it on your own.  \n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Jason Clayton in 4-6 weeks to assess the healing of surgical site and monitor for potential complications related to the large bowel resections."}

Take this \nopportunity and incorporate what you have learned from your \nhealth care team.  Continue being active on a regular basis and \nfollow these healthful guidelines (not diet!) for life long \nbenefits.\n\nIn the hospital, you will be on a stage 3 diet for healing.  \nThis diet includes all liquid, high protein, low sugar and low \nfat supplements.  When you are discharged home, you may advance \nyour diet as tolerated.  Below are some helpful tips to continue \nyour journey of eating well and healthy living.\n\n \n\n1.Keep an eye on calories.\n\n2.Always eat at a table.  Avoid eating while driving, standing, \nsitting on the sofa, or lying in bed.  \n\n3.Eat slowly.  Continue to take 30 minutes to eat a meal and \nchew your foods thoroughly. \n\n4.Surround yourself with healthy foods. Clean out your cabinets \nof any trigger or unsafe foods.\n\n5.Keep a food journal or track your intake on-line.  Record \nwhat you eat, portion sizes, and the time you eat.  You may want \nto include your mood and hunger level, as well.\n\n6.Avoid skipping meals.  Always eat at regular times to avoid \novereating later in the day.\n\n7.Listen to your body.  Eat when you are physically hungry and \nstop when you are full.\n\n8.Be active.  Engage in at least Hartman minutes of physical \nactivity most (if not all) days of the week. \n\n9.Regularly check your weight.  Give yourself an acceptable \nrange (i.e. 5 pounds).  This prevents slip ups from becoming \nbigger problems down the road.\n\n10. Make small changes.  Set small, reasonable goals to keep on \ntrack. \n\n11. Reward yourself.  Treat yourself when you reach goals with \na non-food treat (i.e. pedicure, movie). \n\n12. Ask for support. Call the Diaz nutrition clinic for \nfollow-up at Bayshore Community Hospital.  Join Weight Watchers, talk to friends \nand family or contact a local dietitian. \n\n13. Drink plenty of fluids. Stay hydrated.\n\nFluids & Diet\nFluid intake is extremely important the first month of your \nrecovery. You must also take in enough liquids\nto prevent dehydration. Dehydration can cause nausea, fatigue, \nlightheadedness and dark urine.  We recommend you track what you \ndrink and eat each day. \nMost Frequent Problems\n\nDiscomfort\nAbdominal soreness below your ribs on the left side is the most \ncommon site of tenderness after waking up. Despite this \ndiscomfort, it is very important that you get out of bed and \ntake short walks.\n\nDehydration\nYour most important job after surgery is drinking enough fluid. \nDehydration is the most common reason to return to the hospital \nafter surgery. Your goal is to drink 8 cups (64 oz) of fluid a \nday. You may not be able to drink this much fluid at first, but \ncome as close as you can. Refer to your nutrition\npacket for more details.\n\nWound Drainage & Infection\nIt is important to care for your incisions to prevent infection. \nYou will have small fiber tapes on your wounds. This should keep \nyour wound dry and closed. Leave them on until they fall off by \nthemselves. Do not put band aids, ointments, lotions or powder \non your incisions. You may get your incisions wet but\navoid scrubbing them. Pat them dry. It is not unusual for an \nincision to drain a little bloody fluid after you\ngo home. If you have some drainage, dab the wounds with diluted \nhydrogen peroxide (hydrogen\nperoxide mixed half and half with water) and then cover with a \ndry gauze. Doing this twice a day will\nspeed your recovery.\nInfections are uncommon and rarely serious after a laparoscopic \noperation. An infection will be red, warm,\nfirm, and tender. The infected fluid will look more like pus \nthan like blood. If you notice this please call the\nnurse at the Bariatric Frederick Program to discuss your symptoms.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nSchedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Mark Ramirez in 4-6 weeks to re-evaluate the treatment of dysphagia and assess progress towards recovery. During this visit, you will also have the opportunity to discuss any ongoing concerns or symptoms with Dr. Mark Ramirez."}

You were \nthen transferred from Hayes after imaging of your chest \nwith plain x-rays and chest CT revealed concern for possible \ncomplicated pneumonia and worse pleural effusions or fluid on \nthe lungs. You had a chest tube at outside hospital to attempt \nto drain this fluid but because it was a very small amount it \nwas unable to be successfully drained. \n.\nYou were sent to Brown for additional management of a \nsuspected complicated pneumonia and for further evaluation with \nthe thoracic surgical team. The thoracic surgery specialists did \nnot feel you needed any further procedures or surgeries. Your \npneumonia was managed with IV antibiotics, increased \nsupplemental oxygen and nebulizer treatments to help with \nshortness of breath. You had no additional fevers and your \nbreathing was back to your usual baseline on 2.5L oxygen via \nnasal cannula by time of discharge.

You will need a repeat chest x-ray with \nyour PCP, Howard in about Smith weeks time.\n.\nYou also had recurrence of your known abnormal heart rhythm \ncalled atrial fibrillation. Your rapid heart rate was eventually \ncontrolled on higher doses of metoprolol which should be \ncontinued as an outpatient. The medical team diagnosed you with \nacute kidney injury as well which was attributed to dehydration \nand effects from a diuretic medication (for your diastolic \ncongestive heart failure treatment) called Lasix. After getting \ngentle IV fluids and holding your lasix for several days your \nkidney function returned to normal. \n.\nAfter notice of right lower extremity swelling you had an \nultrasound study which revealed a blood clot in your leg called \na deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Wiley have \nrecovered from this procedure well and Gibson are now ready to \nreturn home. Samples from your colon were taken and this tissue \nhas been sent to the pathology department for analysis. Freeman will \nreceive these pathology results at your follow-up appointment. \nIf there is an urgent need for the surgeon to contact Perkins \nregarding these results they will contact Melton before this time. \nBoone have tolerated a regular diet, are passing gas and your pain \nis controlled with pain medications by mouth. Davis may return \nhome to finish your recovery.\n \nStanton have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a \nnew ileostomy placement is dehydration. The output from the \nstoma is stool from the small intestine and the water content is \nvery high. The stool is no longer passing through the large \nintestine which is where the water from the stool is reabsorbed \ninto the body and the stool becomes formed. Reid must measure \nyour ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output from \nthe stoma should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If \nTerry find that your output has become too much or too little, \nplease call the office for advice. The office nurse or nurse \npractitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the \nileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if Horn notice \nyour ileostomy output increasing, take in more electrolyte drink \nsuch as Gatorade.

The skin around \nthe ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the \nskin around the stoma for bulging or signs of infection listed \nabove. Please care for the ostomy as Simpson have been instructed by \nthe wound/ostomy nurses. Morris will be able to make an appointment \nwith the ostomy nurse in the clinic 7 days after surgery. Campbell \nwill have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks \nhelping to monitor your ostomy until Kelley are comfortable caring \nfor it on your own.\n\nCurrently your ileostomy is allowing the surgery in your large \nintestine to heal, which does take some time.

At your follow-up appointment in the \nclinic, we will decide when is the best time for your second \nsurgery. Until this time there is healthy intestine that is \nstill functioning as it normally would. This functioning healthy \nintestine will continue to produce mucus. Some of this mucus may \nleak or Phelps may feel as though Kramer need to have a bowel movement \n- Shannon may sit on the toilet and empty this mucus as though Farmer \nwere having a bowel movement or wear clothing that prevents \nleakage of this material such as a diaper.\n \nWilliams have Sims laparoscopic surgical incisions on your abdomen \nwhich are closed with internal sutures and a skin glue called \nDermabond.

Your CT imaging however \nshowed that there was nothing concerning in your brain. We \ncontrolled your elevated blood pressure with your home \nmedications and that issue resolved. \n\nIn terms of your dizziness, evaluation by our neurologists \nconcluded that there is most likely inflammation in the \nstructures in your ear. Inflammation in this location can often \naffect balance, your ability to walk, and hearing. You will have \nout-patient neurology follow-up for this issue. As you return \nback home, please take care with walking and avoiding further \nrisks for falls. \n\nYou are being discharged home with physical therapy services. \nYou are leaving on all the same medications that you were taking \nprior to being admitted as well as appropriate follow-up with \nyour primary care physician and Warner neurologist. \n\nIt was a pleasure to care for you. We wish you the very best. \n\nSincerely, \nYour Bell Care Team\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nReturn to see Dr. Joanna Howard in 4-6 days for re-evaluation of dizziness symptoms and to assess need for further treatment or testing.

Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a \nspeedy and uneventful recovery.\n\nDivision of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery\nEndovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair Discharge \nInstructions\n\nPLEASE NOTE: After endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), it is very \nimportant to have regular appointments (every Ponce months) for \nthe rest of your life.  These appointments will include a CT \n(CAT) scan and/or ultrasound of your graft.  If you miss an \nappointment, please call to reschedule. \n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:\n Bruising, tenderness, and a sensation of fullness at the groin \npuncture sites (or incisions) is normal and will go away in \none-two weeks\n\nCARE OF THE GROIN PUNCTURE SITES:\n It is normal to have mild swelling, a small bruise, or small \namounts of drainage at the groin puncture sites.  In two weeks, \nyou may feel a small, painless, pea sized knot at the puncture \nsites.  This too is normal.  Male patients may notice swelling \nin the scrotum.  The swelling will get better over one-two \nweeks.\n Look at the area daily to see if there are any changes.  Be \nsure to report signs of infection.  These include: increasing \nredness; worsening pain; new or increasing drainage, or drainage \nthat is white, yellow, or green; or fever of 101.5 or more.  (If \nyou have taken aspirin, Tylenol, or other fever reducing \nmedicine, wait at least Walker hours after taking it before you \ncheck your temperature in order to get an accurate reading.)\n\nFOR SUDDEN, SEVERE BLEEDING OR SWELLING (Groin puncture site or \nincision)\n If you have sudden, severe bleeding or swelling at either of \nthe groin puncture sites: \n-Lie down, keep leg straight and apply (or have someone apply) \nfirm pressure to area for Cunningham minutes with a gauze pad or \nclean cloth. \n-Once bleeding has stopped, call your surgeon to report what \nhappened.   \n-If bleeding does not stop, call Zuniga for transfer to closest \nEmergency Room. \n You may shower 48 hours after surgery.  Let the soapy water \nrun over the puncture sites, then rinse and pat dry.  Do not rub \nthese sites and do not apply cream, lotion, ointment or powder. \n Wear loose-fitting pants and clothing as this will be less \nirritating to the groin puncture sites. \n\nMEDICATIONS\n Take aspirin daily. Aspirin helps prevent blood clots that \ncould form in your repaired artery. \n It is very important that you never stop taking aspirin or \nother blood thinning medicines-even for a short while- unless \nthe surgeon who repaired your aneurysm tells you it is okay to \nstop.   Do not stop taking them, even if another doctor or nurse \ntells you to, without getting an okay from the surgeon who first \nprescribed them. \n You will be given prescriptions for any new medication started \nduring your hospital stay.\n Before you go home, your nurse Taylor give you information about \nnew medication and will review all the medications you should \ntake at home.  Be sure to ask any questions you may have.  If \nsomething you normally take or may take is not on the list you \nreceive from the nurse, please ask if it is okay to take it.\n \nPAIN MANAGEMENT\n Most patients do not have much pain following this procedure.  \n Your puncture sites may be a little sore.  This will improve \ndaily. If it is getting worse, please let us know.\nYou will be given instructions about taking pain medicine if \nyou need it.\n\nACTIVITY\n You must limit activity to protect the puncture sites in your \ngroin.  For ONE WEEK:\n-Do not drive\n-Do not swim, take a tub bath or go in a Jacuzzi or hot tub\n-Do not lift, push, pull or carry anything heavier than five \npounds\n-Do not do any exercise or activity that causes you to hold your \nbreath or bear down with your abdominal muscles.\n-Do not resume sexual activity\n Discuss with your surgeon when you may return to other regular \nactivities, including work.  If needed, we will give you a \nletter for your workplace. \n It is normal to feel weak and tired.  This can last six-eight \nweeks, but should get better day by day. You may want to have \nhelp around the house during this time.\n Mcgee push yourself too hard during your recovery.  Rest when \nyou feel tired.  Gradually return to normal activities over the \nnext month.\n We encourage you to walk regularly. Walking, especially \noutdoors in good weather is the best exercise for circulation.  \nWalk short distances at first, even in the house, then do a \nlittle more each day.\n It is okay to climb stairs.  You may need to climb them slowly \nand pause after every few steps. \n\nDIET\n It is normal to have a decreased appetite.  Your appetite will \nreturn over time.\n Follow a well balance, heart-healthy diet, with moderate \nrestriction of salt and fat. \n Eat small, frequent meals with nutritious food options (high \nfiber, lean meats, fruits, and vegetables) to maintain your \nstrength and to help with wound healing.\n\nBOWEL AND BLADDER FUNCTION\n You should be able to pass urine without difficulty.  Call you \ndoctor if you have any problems urinating, such as burning, \npain, bleeding, going too often, or having trouble urinating or \nstarting the flow of urine.   Call if you have a decrease in the \namount of urine. \n You may experience some constipation after surgery because of \npain medicine and changes in activity.  Increasing fluids and \nfiber in your diet and staying active can help.  To relief \nconstipation, you may talk a mild laxative.   Please take to \nyour pharmacist for advice about what to take. \n\nSMOKING\n If you smoke, it is very important that you STOP. Research \nshows smoking makes vascular disease worse. This could increase \nthe chance of a blockage in your new graft.  Talk to your \nprimary care physician about ways to quit smoking. \n\nCALLING FOR HELP/DANGER SIGNS\nIf you need help, please call us at Rosalesshire Medical Center.   Remember, \nyour doctor, or someone covering for your doctor, is available \n24 hours a day, seven days a week.   If you call during \nnonbusiness hours, you will reach someone who can help you reach \nthe vascular surgeon on call. \n\nCall your surgeon right away for:\n Pain in the groin area that is not relieved with medication, \nor pain that is getting worse instead of better\n Increased redness at the groin puncture sites\n New or increased drainage from the groin puncture sites, or \nwhite yellow, or green drainage \n Any new bleeding from the groin puncture sites.  For sudden, \nsevere bleeding, apply pressure for Young minutes. If the \nbleeding stops, call your doctor right away to report what \nhappened.  If it does not stop, call Haas\n Fever greater than 101.5 degrees\n Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea or constipation\n Any worsening pain in your abdomen\n Problems with urination\n Changes in color or sensation in your feet or legs \n\nCALL Jackson in an EMERGENCY, such as\n Any sudden, severe pain in the back, abdomen, or chest\n A sudden change in ability to move or use your legs\n Sudden, severe bleeding or swelling at either groin site that \ndoes not stop after applying pressure for Mcclure minutes\n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Aaron Miles in 4 weeks to monitor the sac size and determine if further intervention is necessary due to persistent endoleak and sac expansion despite prior EVAR. You should also schedule an appointment with his office if you experience any new symptoms or worsening of existing symptoms at any time before your scheduled follow-up visit."}

As you know, \nyou were admitted with increased pain in the back.  MRI of the \nspine showed progression of the cancer involvement of the T2 and \nT7 vertebrae.  The T2 vertebra (below the neck), in particular, \nwas collapsed and revealed extension of the break into the \nspinal canal.   It is for this reason, that you should have the \nbrace in place while you are upright.  This can be removed when \nyou are lying down flat with the head below 30 degrees from \nhorizontal.  You have verbalized that you understand the risks \nand potential consequences, namely paralysis, that can occur \nfrom not wearing the brace.\n\n   Because of the limitations with the neck brace, you should \nnot drive for risk of getting into an accident.  Driving without \nthe brace is equally dangerous, as the T2 vertebra may press on \nthe spinal cord and lead to paralysis - and thus a risk for \nyourself and others.  The Mccann Ortiz has been contacted \nand your license is no longer active and you are not permitted \nby law to be driving.\n  \n  Please follow up with Dr. Tiffany Morgan about the \nnext steps for your treatment.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nSchedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Tiffany Morgan in 1-2 weeks to monitor your progress and assess the effectiveness of the treatment plan for your back pain. If you experience any worsening symptoms or concerns before then, please contact Dr. Morgan's office immediately."}

At James you were given ativan and \ndilantin and you had to be intubated to control your seizures \nand protect your breathing.   A CT scan showed that you had no \nstroke or lesion to account for seizures.  At Lopez MRI \nshowed no abnormalities, EEG showed no seizures, and lumbar \npuncture showed no signs of infection.  We changed your \nantiseizure medication to KEPPRA 1000mg twice daily and you were \nsuccessfully extubated on Williams.  During your seizure, you \nfractured your left arm and that was repaired by orthopedics on \nGonzales.  After the surgery you had agitation and tremulousness \nthat was concerning for alcohol withdrawal.  For severe symptoms \nwe gave you ativan as needed, but you improved greatly by Baker.  \nOur physical therapists felt you were appropriate to be \ndischarged to home with home Hood and a cane.  \n\nThere was no abnormality with your brain or infection to explain \nwhy you had a seizure.  Given your tremulousness and agitation, \nwe suspect that your seizure may be related to alcohol intake.  \nIt is very improtant that you make continued efforts to stop \ndrinking, as withdrawal from alcohol will put you at risk for \nrepeat seizures. Please take the medications listed on this \nsummary (KEPPRA/LEVETIRACETAM) and come to the follow-up \nappointments we have arranged.  Thank you for allowing us to \nparticipate in your care.\n\nYou also have a fracture of your left arm as well as \ndislocation. The Orthopedic Surgeons operated and fixed this \nissue. They want you to followup in the Orthopedics Trauma \nClinic on the Elliott of Hernandez in Horton days from discharge. \nThey also want you to follow these instructions:\n1. Keep your arm at your side. Do not perform any range of \nmotion exercises. Your physical therapists may perform \n\"pendulum\" exercises which they will tell you about.\n2. You do not need to place a dressing on the surgical wound \nunless there is drainage. If so, you can place a clean gauze \nbandage with medical tape on the surgical wound as needed.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nSchedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Wellesley in 1 week to assess the effectiveness of current treatment and adjust as necessary for seizure management. Please call our office to schedule this appointment at your earliest convenience."}

For your low vitamin \nlevels, you will need to start taking injections of B12 as \ndescribed below, as well as taking daily iron pills.  We also \nmade some changes to your diabetes pills (your sugars were too \nlow and we wanted to reduce some of your diabetes medications). \n.\nYour medication changes are summarized as below:\nSTOP actos - this can make your heart disease worse\nSTOP Glimepiride - this may have led to your low sugars\n\n->START amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day for a urinary tract \ninfection for an additional 4 days. \n->START vitamin B12 injections daily (this will be arranged with \nyour primary care doctor, please speak to your PCP about this)\n->START metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day - this is for your heart\n->START losartan 25 mg daily - this is also for your heart\n->START aspirin 81 mg daily - this helps prevent the future risk \nof heart attack\n->START ferrous sulfate - this is for replenishing your iron\n\n-> CHANGE lantus to 20 units in the morning; you should continue \nyour metformin as normal.    \n \nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Kessler in 3 weeks to monitor the progression of your dilated cardiomyopathy and adjust treatment as necessary. During this visit, Dr. Kessler will review your medication regimen and perform any additional tests or examinations deemed necessary for your ongoing care."}

An ultrasound of the \nheart (echocardiogram) showed that your heart does not pump as \nhard as it should, a condition called \"systolic heart failure\". \nA procedure called an cardiac catheterization was performed to \nlook at the blood vessels that supply the heart, as blockages to \nthese arteries can cause this condition. Your cardiac \ncatheterization showed clean blood vessels, which leads us to \nbelieve your systolic heart failure may be due to your heavy \nalcohol use. \n\nWe have started you on several medications to protect your heart \nand help it beat stronger, but the most important thing you can \ndo for this condition is to stop drinking alcohol. Please ask \nyour primary care doctor about resources to help you do this. \n**Continuing to drink could be dangerous to your health and even \nfatal**\n\nDrinking too much alcohol also puts you at risk for vitamin \ndeficiences, so we recommend that you start taking folate and \nthiamine, two vitamins now included in your medication list. \n\nYour heart condition puts you at risk for having excess fluid \nbuild up in your lungs and legs. Please weigh yourself every \nmorning and call your doctor if your weight increases by more \nthan 3 pounds in 5 days. You should also keep a low sodium diet \n(less than 2g or 2000mg per day) and try to drink only 1.5L or \n50 ounces of fluids a day.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Cody Stanley in 2 weeks for a re-evaluation of your cardiac function and to assess the effectiveness of any prescribed treatments for suspected alcoholic cardiomyopathy."}

This fluid in your lungs may have been due \nto a heart attack, heart failure, a blood clot in your lungs, or \na combination of these issues.  It is very likely that you had a \nblood clot in your lungs, but we did not do the CT test to \nconfirm this, given that it would likely further harm your \nkidneys.  We also did not treat you for this blood clot, given \nthat the treatment would increase your risk of having blood in \nyour urine and increase the risk of you dying from a bleed in \nyour gastrointestinal tract or head, especially if you were to \nfall.  Your family agreed with this plan.\n\nWe gave you Lasix (a diuretic) to decrease the fluid around your \nlungs.  After we did this, your breathing improved.  \n\nFor your heart, we gave you aspirin (an increased dose compared \nto what you used to take), metoprolol (a beta-blocker, which \ndecreases the work that your heart has does when pumping blood), \nand atorvastatin (which decreases cholesterol plaque formation \nin your arteries).  \n\nYou also had blood in your urine, which may have been coming \nfrom your prostate or your bladder.  We transfused you with red \nblood cells in order to increase your red blood cell level.  The \nbleeding stabilized.  Please follow up with urology at the \nappointment time listed below.\n\nThank you for allowing us to take part in your care.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Julie Skinner in 3 weeks for a re-evaluation of your primary condition and to assess progress towards recovery.

We \nbelieve this was most likely due to extra fluid in your lungs. \nWhen you first arrived to our Emergency Department, a tube was \nplaced in your throat to help you breathe (intubation).  You \nwere admitted to the intensive care unit, where you were given a \nmedication (Lasix) to help decrease the fluid in your lungs.  \nYou were treated with steroids to decrease possible inflammation \nin your lungs.  You also received antibiotics to cover the \nbacteria that cause lung infections. You responded well to these \ntreatments and your breathing tube was eventually removed.\n\nIn the ICU, you had an ultrasound of your heart (Echo) which \nshowed slightly worsened disease of one of your heart valves \n(from rheumatic heart disease).  Your heart function is \notherwise unchanged from your last echo in Holland.  \n\nYou were then transferred to the medicine floor, where you \ncompleted the course of antibiotics. You were continued on \nsteroids.  Your IV Lasix was transitioned to Lasix by mouth, and \nyou continued to put out a considerable amount of extra fluid \nwhich helped your oxygenation.  Your oxygen requirements \ndecreased to your home oxygen of 6 Liters.  You were able to \nambulate on your own without issue. You will go home on lasix \n60mg daily. This dose might be lowered to 40mg daily after you \nsee your primary care doctor next week if she feels it is \nappropriate.\n\nYour sugars were found to be elevated, especially after starting \nprednisone. We had diabetes specialists see you who helped to \ntitrate your insulin. You will go home on Insulin Sliding Scale \nregimen that was reviewed with you in the hospital. Please \nfollow the attached Sliding Scale regimen.\n\nOn the day of discharge you had some chest pain with breathing.  \nWe obtained a CT scan of your lungs and it showed there is no \nclot in your lungs, this is good news.\n\nRemember to check daily weights. If your weight goes up by 3 \npounds, please call Dr Fischer might need a higher dose of \nyour lasix. This is VERY important. If you can not get through \nto Dr Payne call your primary care doctor.\n\nThe following changes were made to your medications:\nSTOP Metformin. Do not take this medication any more. It should \nnot be taken by patients with heart failure.\nSTOP Aldactone. You may resume this if your PCP agrees and if \nyour blood pressure tolerates. We started you on metoprolol and \ndecided to stop the aldactone for now.\nSTART insulin sliding scale with Novolog, see the attached form \nfor an explanation.\nCHANGED lantus from 20->24 U every evening\nSTART: Bactrim, take 1 tab daily to prevent pneumonia while on \nsteroids.\nSTART: Pantoprazole 40mg daily, take this while on steroids\nSTART Prednisone 40 mg daily.

You were treated with \nfluid and antibiotics for presumed abdominal infection, and you \nwere transferred to the Hopkins, \nfirst in the intensive care unit, and then here on the general \nmedicine floor. Your kidney function appears to be recovering \nnow, but your anemia is still being worked up.  The hematology \noncology team here performed a bone marrow biopsy, and the \nresult will be communicated to your primary care physician, and \nthis can be followed up on an outpatient basis. You also \nunderwent esophageal retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) \nto evaluate your common bile duct stone. The stone was \ncalcified, and its large size and integration into the common \nbile duct wall prevented a safe and swift removal with the ERCP. \nConsequently, a metal stent of 10 Faulkner diameter was placed to \nallow normal bile flow.\nAfter ERCP, your routine electrocardiogram showed new changes \nthat were concerning for cardiac ischemia. We therefore \nunderwent a series of blood test to assess whether your heart \nwas sufferring from an acute injury. Over the next Fitzgerald hours, \nyour cardiac enzymes, although slightly elevated, did not \nincrease, and we concluded that the elevated level might be \nsecondary to your suboptimal kidney function, rather than as a \nresult of cardiac injury. You also underwent echocardiography as \npart of this evaluation, and it did not show any new cardiac \nwall motion abnormality suggesting heart muscle injury from \nischemia; nor was there evidence of any acute cardiac event. \nLastly, during your stay at the Webb, a CT \nscan of your abdomen showed a cirrhotic appearing liver with a \n~1cm hypodense lesion. This needs to be followed up with your \nprimary care physician as an outpatient issue.  You will have a \nrepeat ERCP here at Cedarview Community Healthcare System. in one month to re-evaluate your \ncommon bile duct stone and the newly placed stent. \n\nGiven the change in your cardiac status, we decided to add \nseveral medications.  You should continue to take metoprolol, \naspirin, and atorvastatin.  Please speak with your primary care \nphysician as to whether you should continue these medications.  \nIf you remain on atorvastatin you will need to have your liver \nenzymes monitored.\nIn addition, you will need to have a stress test within one week \nof discharge from the hospital.  This may be arranged by your \nprimary care doctor. \n\nYour lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide were being held because \nof the decreased kidney function.  Your lisinopril was restarted \nat half your normal dose on the day of discharge. You will need \nto meet with your primary care doctor to decide whether you can \nrestart the hydrochlorothiazide, and whether he wants to \nincrease the lisinopril to your normal dose. \nPlease contact your physician or return to the emergency room if \nyou experience severe abdominal pain, chest pain, acute \nshortness of breath, fever, sudden dizziness or weakness, or any \nworsening signs and symptoms.     \n \nFollowup Instructions:\nReturn to see Dr. Julianne Rutledge in 3 days for re-evaluation of your condition and to discuss further treatment options related to your diagnosis of Choledocholithiasis. Schedule this appointment at your earliest convenience by contacting our office directly to book an appointment."}

If you experience vomiting and abdominal \npain please return to the hospital. \n\nWhile you were in Preston you had a procedure where a \nendoscope was placed into your stomach and intestine to look at \nthe mass. A biopsy of the mass was taken and the results are not \ncomplete at this time but preliminary results are concerning for \na hematologic malignancy, potentially lymphoma. You also \nreceived a CAT scan of your torso. This scan showed the mass \nlocated in the first part of your intestines pressing up against \nyour pancreas. It is unclear from the scan if the mass has \nentered the pancreas.\n\nWe recommend that you follow-up in the hematologic malignancy \nclinic at Lakeshore Community Hospital.   This will allow \nyou to learn the final diagnosis and start planning for \nchemotherapy treatment. You decided that you want to follow-up \nwith a oncologist near your home town.  This will require URGENT \naction on your part, and requesting records and pathology \nresults and samples to be sent to the oncologist of your \nchoosing.  We urge you to follow-up with your primary care \ndoctor as soon as possible to coordinate this.  \nMeanwhile, if you choose to follow-up at Miller, \nplease call Owen to schedule an appointment to be seen. \nAlternatively, call Brown, which is number for the \nhematologic malignancy department. \n\nYour CAT scan also showed a small nodule in your lungs. You will \nneed to have a biopsy of this nodule to determine whether it is \nrelated to the findings in your abdomen. You should follow-up \nwith the interventional radiology team for this biopsy. \n\nWe recommend that you adhere to a liquid diet to prevent \nrecurrent obstruction. \n\nWhile you were in the hospital the nutritionist team recommended \nthat you take Thiamine supplements for 5 days given that you had \nnot been eating before coming to the hospital. You have be \nprescribed Thiamine  for discharge. Please continue the ___y taking the Thiamine until Grant as directed. \n\nIt has been a pleasure to care for you. We wish you the best.\n\nSincerely, \nYour Hurley Care Team  \n \nFollowup Instructions:\nThe patient is instructed to return to Dr. Chad Conrad's office in 4 weeks for a follow-up appointment to assess the effectiveness of the current treatment plan and to monitor any changes in symptoms related to the gastric outlet obstruction and duodenal mass. The patient should contact Dr. Conrad's office if there are any concerns or changes in condition before the scheduled appointment date."}

You were admitted \nfor worsening lower leg swelling and worsening shortness of \nbreath with walking. We were concerned that you may have had a \nclot travel to your lungs and you were started on a blood \nthinner. Tests showed that you most likely did not have a lung \nclot. The blood thinner medication was stopped. You most likely \nhave heart failure due to a combination of factors including \nyour obstructive sleep apnea, weight, and high blood pressure \ngiven that these symptoms have been getting worse over the last \nyear to weeks. You were given a pill to help you urinate which \nhelped remove fluid from your lungs. You improved during your \nstay: leg swelling improved, and you did not require oxygen at \ntime of discharge. You were sent home with this medication (to \nhelp remove extra fluid) as well as potassium supplements.\n\nBefore you left, you noticed that the tops of your feet were \nred. We were not concerned for infection and we encouraged you \nto keep your feet elevated when sitting. Please bring this to \nyour PCP's attention if it has not resolved by the time of your \nappointment. \n\nNEW MEDICATIONS:\nLasix 20mg daily\nPotassium chloride 40meq once daily\n(But please be sure NOT to take one medication without the \nother. If you do NOT take the lasix, do NOT take the potassium. \nPlease take both together.)\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease return to see Dr. Ana Dean in 4 weeks for a re-evaluation and adjustment of your treatment plan as necessary, or sooner if you experience any worsening of symptoms or concerns. It is essential that you follow up with Dr. Ana Dean as directed to ensure optimal management of your heart failure."}

It does not \nspread from person to person.

This helps lessen pain and \nswelling. This works best if the arm or leg is raised above the \nlevel of your heart.\n* Rest until the fever and pain are gone and the skin is less \nred. If your infection is severe, you should not get out of bed.\n* Do not go swimming until the skin is no longer infected.\n* when flying on long flights, consider taking 81 mg asprin one \na day for two days before flight, and day of flight.

Most \nlikley, the cause of you initial fevers was due to the cat and \ndog bite that you suffered prior to coming in. Your fevers \nimproved without antibiotics, and your blood cultures never \nidentified an infectious source. You were treated with \nVancomycin by mouth which is for the C Diff infection as well. \nIn your last four days here, you did not have a fever and you \ndid quite well. You were evaluated by physical therapy and they \nworked with you during your last two days here. You were having \nsome trouble walking by yourself but seemed to improve with \ntheir sessions, so you were deemed safe to go home. On your \nfinal day, your blood pressure dropped a little bit while \nwalking with the physical therapy. However, you felt fine and \nyour blood pressure improved quickly, so we decreased the dose \nof Losartan (now on 50 mg daily) and discontinued the Felodipine \nto help keep your blood pressure normal. It is very important \nthat you see your PCP White 1:45 on Hughes to follow up on these \nissues. It was a pleasure taking care of you. Thanks!\n\nAll the best,\nYour care team at Brookside Community Hospital and Medical Group.  \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Jerry Johnson in 3-5 business days for a review of your current symptoms and to assess the effectiveness of your treatment plan, or sooner if you experience any worsening of your fevers."}

You were initially evaluated with imaging of your \nhead (head CT) which showed atrophy (weakening) of the \ncerebellum (part of the brain). This was likely due to chronic \nalcohol use in the past. The ataxia and slowing of your thinking \nwas also likely due to the chronic alcohol use in the past. In \norder to help improve your thinking, we gave you a vitamin \ncalled thiamine which helped improve your thinking as well as \nyour balance. We also continued you with other vitamins and \nminerals including Vitamin B12, folic acid, a multivitamin. We \nalso had the neurologists (brain doctors) come and see you to \nevaluate your unsteadiness on your feet and slowed thinking. \nThey also recommended continuing with the vitamins that we had \nbeen giving you. The neurologists would also like to have you \nseen as an outpatient with a neurologist within the At___ \nnetwork. We also had social work come see you to discuss options \nregarding resources to help quit alcohol consumption.   We \nrecommended that you stay in the hospital given your ongoing \ndifficulty with standing and climbing stairs, and need for \nphysical therapy as well as ongoing IV thiamine.  You elected to \nleave against medical advice.  You were advised of the risks of \nleaving against medical advice, including falling with \npossibility of serious injury including death, worsening \nconfusion, poor pain control and worsening of gout.  You \nunderstood and accepted these risks and elected to leave against \nmedical advice regardless.\n\nWhile in the hospital, you were also treated for a gout flare.  \nYou should continue to take naproxen for 2 days after your \nsymptoms resolve and you should contact your PCP if your \nsymptoms last for more than a week.\n\nWe encourage you to continue taking these vitamins as they are \nhelping improve your symptoms.  \n\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital!\n\nSincerely,\nYour Guerrero Care Team \n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Mark Miller in 4 weeks to monitor the progression of Graves's Encephalopathy and assess the effectiveness of the current treatment plan.

Miller have \nrecovered from this procedure well and Livingston are now ready to \nreturn home. Samples from your colon were taken and this tissue \nhas been sent to the pathology department for analysis. Duran will \nreceive these pathology results at your follow-up appointment. \nIf there is an urgent need for the surgeon to contact Bradley \nregarding these results they will contact Davis before this time. \nLang have tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is \ncontrolled with pain medications by mouth. Hale may return home \nto finish your recovery.\n\nIf Davis have any of the following symptoms please call the office \nfor advice Collins:\nfever greater than 101.5\nincreasing abdominal distension\nincreasing abdominal pain\nnausea/vomiting\ninability to tolerate food or liquids\nprolonged loose stool\nextended constipation\ninability to urinate\n\nIncisions:\nNewman have small laparascopic incision sites with steri-strips in \nplace. Those will eventually fall off on their own. This is \nhealing well however it is important that Havenbrook Community Hospital. monitor these \nareas for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing \nredness of the incision lines, white/green/yellow/malodorous \ndrainage, increased pain at the incision, increased warmth of \nthe skin at the incision, or swelling of the area.\nMiranda may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. \nThe small incisions may be left open to the air. If closed with \nsteri-strips (little white adhesive strips), these will fall off \nover time, please do not remove them. Please no baths or \nswimming until cleared by the surgical team.\n\nIt is expected that Havenbrook Community Hospital. may still have pain after surgery and \nthis pain will gradually improved over the course of your stay \nhere. Ruiz will especially have pain when changing positions and \nwith movement. Meza should continue to take 2 Extra Strength \nTylenol (Thomas) for pain every 8 hours around the clock and Huang \nmay also take Advil (Ibuprofen) 600mg every hours for 7 days. \nPlease do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 hours or \nany other medications that contain Tylenol such as cold \nmedication. Do not drink alcohol while or Tylenol. Please take \nAdvil with food. If these medications are not controlling your \npain to a point where Scott can ambulate and preform minor tasks, \nCox should take a dose of the narcotic pain medication \noxycodone. Please take this only if needed for pain. Do not take \nwith any other sedating medications or alcohol. Do not drive a \ncar if taking narcotic pain medications.\n\nWhite may feel weak or \"washed out\" for up to 6 weeks after \nsurgery. No heavy lifting greater than a gallon of milk for 3 \nweeks. Stark may climb stairs. Rivera may go outside and walk, but \navoid traveling long distances until Valencia speak with your \nsurgical team at your first follow-up visit. Your surgical team \nwill clear Nguyen for heavier exercise and activity as the observe \nyour progress at your follow-up appointment. Freeman should only \ndrive a car on your own if Jones are off narcotic pain medications \nand feel as if your reaction time is back to normal so Rodriguez can \nreact appropriately while driving.\n\nMendoza have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a \nnew ileostomy placement is dehydration. The output from the \nstoma is stool from the small intestine and the water content is \nvery high. The stool is no longer passing through the large \nintestine which is where the water from the stool is reabsorbed \ninto the body and the stool becomes formed. Singleton must measure \nyour ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output from \nthe stoma should not be more than 1500cc or less than 500cc. If \nCampbell find that your output has become too much or too little, \nplease call the office for advice. The office nurse or nurse \npractitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the \nileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if Bailey notice \nyour ileostomy output increasing, take in more electrolyte drink \nsuch as Gatorade. Please monitor yourself for signs and symptoms \nof dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon standing), \nweakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue. If Andrews notice these \nsymptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room \nfor evaluation if these symptoms are severe. Romero may eat a \nregular diet with your new ileostomy. However it is a good idea \nto avoid fatty or spicy foods and follow diet suggestions made \nto Sullivan by the ostomy nurses.\n\nKlein monitor the appearance of the ostomy and stoma and care \nfor it as instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. Rodriguez stoma \n(intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be \nbeefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times \nwhen touched and this should subside with time. The skin around \nthe ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the \nskin around the stoma for bulging or signs of infection listed \nabove. Please care for the ostomy as Hawkins have been instructed by \nthe wound/ostomy nurses. Jones will be able to make an appointment \nwith the ostomy nurse in the clinic 7 days after surgery. Turner \nwill have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks \nhelping to monitor your ostomy until Murray are comfortable caring \nfor it on your own.\n\nThank Garza for allowing us to participate in your care! Our hope \nis that Havenbrook Community Hospital. will have a quick return to your life and usual \nactivities. Good luck!\n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Julianne Wellesley in 2 weeks to review your recovery progress and discuss any changes to your treatment plan as needed following your recent surgery for familial adenomatous polyposis."}

We \nare not sure why you're heart rate is so high, but we think that \nit may be due to post-embolization syndrome, which occurs as the \nblood supply to the uterine fibroid ceases. We expect these \nsymptoms to improve gradually seven days following your \nprocedure. If these symptoms fail to improve, or worsen, please \nseek medical attention.\n\nPlease seek medical attention if you develop high fevers, \nchills, chest pain, shortness of breath, worsening abdominal \npain, blood in your urine, numbness or tingling, \nlightheadedness, or any other symptom that concerns you.\n\nWe wish you all the best of health,\n\nYour Johnson Healthcare team\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease return to see Dr. Julianne Moreno in 2 weeks for a re-evaluation of your uterine fibroids and to assess the effectiveness of the embolization procedure.

Therefore, we advice you to see an \nophthalmologist to have formal visual field testing (appointment \nmade and listed below) and refrain from driving for the time \nbeing. You may also contact our DriveWise program (Smith) \nfor formal driving evaluation. We have also did a CT scan of \nyour chest, abdomen and pelvis and it did not show evidence of \nmalignancy. Please continue to take Keppra to reduce the risk of \nseizure in the setting of your bleed.\n\nNew medications:\n- Tylenol Baird every 6 hours as needed for headache.\n- Oxycodone 5mg every 4 hours as needed for severe headache.\n- Keppra 500mg twice a day to reduce seizure risk.\n- Zofran 8mg every 8 hours as needed for nausea.\n- Gabapentin 300mg three times a day for headache. You may \nincrease the total daily dose by 300mg as tolerated every 3 \ndays. For example, after taking 300mg/300mg/300mg for three \ndays, you may increase to 300mg/300mg/600mg. Then, after 3 days, \nyou may increase to 300mg/600mg/600mg. Then, after 3 days, you \nmay increase to 600mg/600mg/600mg. Please note that the maximum \ndose should NOT exceed 600mg three times a day.\n\nWe recommend a follow up MRI with and without contrast in 3 \nmonths. Please call Williams to schedule an appointment.\n\nPlease attend the follow up appointments as listed below.\n\nYou will need a repeat MRI with contrast in 3 months.\n\nCall your doctor or go to the emergency room if you experience \nany of the danger signs listed below.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Julianne Fletcher in 7 to 10 days for a repeat MRI and to assess the stability of the intraparenchymal bleed in the left brain, and continue taking your prescribed medication as directed until then."}

About Lewis weeks after the operation, pieces of the \nscab will fall off and come out with the urine. As this occurs, \nbleeding may be noted which is normal. You should not worry \nabout this. Simply lie down and increase your fluid intake for a \nfew hours. In most cases, the urine will clear. If bleeding \noccurs or persists for more than 12 hours or if clots appear \nimpairing your stream, call your surgeon. Because of the \npotential for bleeding, aspirin (or Advil) should be avoided for \nthe first 3 weeks after surgery. You will be given a \nprescription for antibiotics to be taken for a few days after \nsurgery. This is to help prevent infection. If you develop a \nfever over 101°, chills, or pain in the testicles, call your \nsurgeon. Although not common, this may indicate infection that \nhas developed beyond the control of the antibiotics that you \nhave taken. It will take 6 weeks from the date of surgery to \nfully recovery from your operation. This can be divided into two \nparts -- the first 2 weeks and the last 4 weeks. During the \nfirst 2 weeks from the date of your surgery, it is important to \nbe \"a person of leisure\". You should avoid lifting and \nstraining, which also means that you should avoid constipation. \nThis can be done by any of 3 ways: 1) modify your diet, 2) use \nstool softeners which have been prescribed for you, and 3) use \ngentle laxatives such as Milk of Magnesia which can be purchased \nat your local drug store. Remember that the prostate is near the \nrectum, and therefore, it is important for you to be mindful of \nthe way you sit. For example, sitting directly upright on a hard \nsurface, such as an exercise bicycle Perez cause bleeding. \nReclining on a soft sea, or sitting on a \"donut\", is best. \nWalking (not jogging) is okay. You should avoid sexual activity \nduring this time. Also, avoid driving an automobile. This is \nimportant, not because you are physically incapable of driving, \nbut rather if you have an urge to urinate, it is important that \nyou void and not let your bladder \"stretch\" too much, otherwise \nbleeding may occur. Therefore, it is OK for you to be a \npassenger in an automobile (or even to drive for very short \ndistances). During the second Rodriguez week period of your recovery, \nyou may begin regular activity, but only on a graduated basis. \nFor example, you may feel well enough to return to work, but you \nmay find it easier to begin on a half-day basis. It is common to \nbecome quite tired in the afternoon, and if such occurs, it is \nbest to take a nap! If you are a golfer, you may begin to swing \na golf club at this time. Sexual activity may be resumed during \nthe second 3 week period, but only on a limited basis. Remember \nthat the ejaculate may be directed back into the bladder (rather \nthan out), producing a \"dry\" orgasm which is a normal \nconsequence of the operation. This should not change the quality \nof sex. In general, your overall activity may be escalated to \nnormal as you progress through this second time period, such \nthat by Rollins weeks following the date of surgery, you should be \nback to normal activity. Remember that your operation was a \n\"scraping\" operation and not all of the prostate was removed. \nTherefore, you should still be monitored for prostate cancer \n(assuming age and general medical conditions dictate such). \n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Susan White in 4 weeks to assess the effectiveness of your current treatment plan and discuss any necessary adjustments for managing your benign prostatic hypertrophy symptoms. During this visit, we will also review your medication regimen and answer any questions you may have about your care under Dr. Susan White's supervision."}

We added predinsone for the inflammation \nin your lungs which should not be discontinued without first \ndicussing it with your physician.  Steroids can weaken your \nimmune system so we started you on a daily antibiotic (Bactrim) \nto prevent infection. Steroids can also weaken your bones and \ncause stomach upset so we started Calcium, Vitamin D, and \nProtonix.  Please also continue to take your synthroid.\n.\nIf you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, \ncough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, swelling in your legs, \ndifficulty lying flat, or dizziness, please call your doctor or \ngo to your local emergency room.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Lisa Rojas in 1-3 weeks to reassess your condition and monitor progress towards recovery.

You were admitted because you have \nbeen experiencing symptoms of fatigue, weakness, \nlightheadedness, 12 lb. unintentional weight loss, low appetite, \nand low blood pressure measured at home for the past two months, \nwith worsening lightheadedness and fatigue in the past week. In \nthe hospital you were treated with intravenous fluids out of \nconcern that you may have been dehydrated. Your sodium and \ncortisol levels were low, which taken together with the rest of \nyour history, suggests a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. The \nadrenal glands secrete hormones that regulate the body's salt \nand water balance, as well as make us feel energized. We think \nthat your adrenal glands may have become inflamed. We do not \nknow why this happens, although it is more common in young \nCaucasian women. We will treat you with a short course of \nsteroids, a class of medication that reduces inflammation. Also, \nwe noticed that your thyroid stimulating hormone level was high, \nalthough your thyroid hormone level itself was \nborderline/normal. This finding should be rechecked at \noutpatient follow up. \n\nPlease follow up with your primary care doctor at the \nappointment listed below.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Avery Wellesley in 4 weeks to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed, and contact her office if you experience any worsening of symptoms or side effects between now and then."}

Please \nfollow the instructions below to continue your recovery:\n\nApply ice: Ice helps decrease swelling and pain. Ice may also \nhelp prevent tissue damage. Use an ice pack or put crushed ice \nin a plastic bag. Cover it with a towel and place it on your \nface for 15 to 20 minutes every hour as directed.\nKeep your head elevated: Keep you head above the level of your \nheart as often as you can. This will help decrease swelling and \npain. Prop your head on pillows or blankets to keep it elevated \ncomfortably.\nAvoid putting pressure on your face:\n-Do not sleep on the injured side of your face. Pressure on the \narea of your injury may cause further damage.\n-Sneeze with your mouth open to decrease pressure on your broken \nfacial bones. Too much pressure from a sneeze may cause your \nbroken bones to move and cause more damage.\n-Try not to blow your nose because it may cause more damage if \nyou have a fracture near your eye. The pressure from blowing \nyour nose may pinch the nerve of your eye and cause permanent \ndamage.\n\nContact your primary healthcare provider Mcclure:\nYou have double vision or you suddenly have problems with your \neyesight.\nYou have questions or concerns about your condition or care.\n\nReturn to the emergency department if:\nYou have clear or pinkish fluid draining from your nose or \nmouth.\nYou have numbness in your face.\nYou have worsening pain in your eye or face.\nYou suddenly have trouble chewing or swallowing.\nYou suddenly feel lightheaded and short of breath.\nYou have chest pain when you take a deep breath or cough. You \nmay cough up blood.\nYour arm or leg feels warmer, more tender, or more painful. It \nmay look swollen and red.\n\nRegarding your knee injury:\nRest your knee so it can heal. Limit activities that increase \nyour pain.\nIce can help reduce swelling. Wrap ice in a towel and put it on \nyour knee for as long and as often as directed.\nCompression with a brace or bandage can help reduce swelling. \nUse a brace or bandage only as directed.\nElevation helps decrease pain and swelling. Elevate your knee \nwhile you are sitting or lying down. Prop your leg on pillows to \nkeep your knee above the level of your heart.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Julianne Patel in 2 weeks for a re-evaluation of your right orbital floor fracture and to assess the need for further treatment or surgery to address any remaining symptoms. If you experience increased pain, swelling, or vision changes before then, contact Dr. Julianne Patel's office immediately for assistance."}

The \nbrain is the part of your body that controls and directs all the \nother parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being \ndeprived of its blood supply can result in a variety of \nsymptoms.  \n\nYou went to an outside hospital where a cat scan of your brain \nwas done which showed a worrisome lesion. You then were \ntransferred to Skinner in Rodriguez where we ran two more tests \nincluding two MRI brain scans. We initially thought that the \nlesion in your brain could have been a mass but on further \ntesting the finding is more consistent with a stroke. \n\nStroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for \nmedical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. \nIn order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk \nfactors. Your risk factors are:\n \nATRIAL FIBRILLATION\nDIABETES\nHYPERLIPIDEMIA\nHYPERTENSION\n\nWe are worried that you were not taking your medications because \nyour sugar was also high in your blood, therefore we have \nstarted you on INSULIN. Your heart rate was low and your blood \npressure was good while you were in the hospital, so we \ndecreased your ATENOLOL from 50mg daily to 12.5mg daily.\n\nYou worked with physical therapy who recommended rehab to get \nyou better and safe as you had this stroke affecting your \nbalance. \n\nIn two weeks we would like to repeat a scan to ensure that your \nstroke is improving. In the meantime, do not re-start the \neliquis (apixaban) until the scan is done. Once the repeat brain \nscan has been completed, your facility should re-start the blood \nthinner at that time. \n\nThank you for involving us in your care.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRodriguez Neurology\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Julianne Fletcher in 1-2 weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as needed, or sooner if you experience increased dizziness, numbness, or weakness on one side of your body."}

We also stopped the warfarin \nto bring your level back to normal which helped stop the \nbleeding. We also started a medication Clark pantoprazole which \ndecreases the acid in your stomach which may also help stop \nbleeding. You will need to restart the warfarin Gonzalez \nNicholson. Because the warfarin was stopped you will need to take \na medicine called enoxaparin for a couple days before the \nwarfarin will be effective again.

We changed your \nintravenous medications to oral medications and you did well. \n.\nPlease take your ibuprofen liquid as your first option for \nthroat pain and add acetaminophen (tylenol) if your pain is not \ncontrolled. If the pain was not controlled with both \nmedications, then you can try the oxycodone liquid. Continue to \ntake the senna, colace, and Miralax while you are taking the \noxycodone as the oxycodone can cause you to become constipated. \n.\nMake sure you continue to drink well and eat when you can. \nDrinking is more important than eating at this point.

Chest/Abdominal pain free >36 hours\n\n \nDischarge Instructions:\nYou have been diagnosed with an ST elevation myocardial \ninfarction (heart attack). During your hospital stay you \nunderwent a cardiac catheterization procedure where they saw a \nblockage in your left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery \nand placed a stent to open the blockage and allow blood to flow \nto your heart. Because they placed a stent to keep the vessel \nopen, you will need to be on a blood thinner called clopidogrel \n(Plavix) to prevent platelets from forming a clot on the new \nstent. \n\nAfter your heart attack, your heart function has become \nsignificantly limited. As we discussed, it is unclear how much \nof this poor function is temporary and how much of this will be \npermanent. The best way to check will be for you to have Dr. Bobby Robinson an ultrasound of your heart in 6 to 12 weeks to \ndetermine how much of the damage is permanent. But because your \nheart function is currently poor, there is poor blood movement \nin your heart and there is a risk for a clot to develop in the \nheart. Therefore, you will be taking a medicine called Warfarin \n(Coumadin) to help thin your blood. While on this medicine, you \nwill need to have your blood checked weekly. The hope is that \nyour cardiac function will improve in Hall weeks and then you \nwill no longer need to take Warfarin (Coumadin), however there \nis a chance that you might need to take this for life. \n\nFinally, you will need to follow up with our electrophysiology \ndepartment in 3 months in order to assess whether you qualify \nfor intracardiac device (ICD) to protect your heart from \npotentially fatal rhythms. As we discussed, for now, this would \nnot be an appropriate treatment until we know how much of the \nheart damage reverses and how much of the damage to your heart \nis permanent. This will be determined by the ultrasound of your \nheart in Hanson weeks.  \n\nIf you develop sudden crushing chest pain, or the same abdominal \npain that brought you to the ER with or without shortness of \nbreath, sweating please return to the emergency room. \n \nFollowup Instructions:\nPlease schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Bobby Robinson in 1-2 weeks to monitor your heart function and adjust treatment as needed. Dr. Robinson will assess your progress during this visit and provide further instructions for recovery."}

For the occluded vessel, there \nis no surgical correction indicated, and your body has developed \nalternative vessels to bring blood to the portion of the brain \nnormally supplied by the occluded vessel. The stroke (low blood \nflow to the brain) affected a region of the brain that is \nimportant in vision, and on examination, you have a small visual \nfield cut (loss of vision). You might have difficulty with \nvision when looking up and to the left.  \n\nOur goal now is to prevent you from having development of other \nocclusions in important brain blood vessels and to prevent \nanother stroke. First, we have started you on aspirin 81 mg \ndaily and clopidogrel 75mg daily. After 3 months, you can stop \nthe clopidogrel. These medications, which helps to prevent blood \nclotting, has been shown to reduce risk of stroke recurrence.  \nYou were also found to have high cholesterol and have been \nstarted on a cholesterol lowering medication, atorvastatin 40 mg \ndaily.  The ultrasound (echocardiogram) of your heart did not \ndemonstrate a hole or a clot in your heart. \n\nIn addition to starting the above two medications, we highly \nrecommend that you stop smoking cigarettes as this is a major \nrisk factor for stroke.  We also recommend a heart healthy diet \nand engaging in regular physical activity. \n\nThank you for allowing us to care for you, \nClements Stroke Team  \n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Alexandra Patel in 2 weeks to reassess your condition and progress after the right posterior cerebral artery infarct diagnosis, and inform her if you experience any worsening of symptoms or concerns between appointments."}

Your PCP Mcmahon advise you on \nwhether to continue your medications for bladder spasm and dry \nmouth.\n   If you start to become more confused or lethargic, please \nimmediately stop taking the duloxetine and call your doctor.\n\nPlease see the information below for your upcoming appointments.\n\nIt has been a pleasure taking care of you at the Ramirez.\n-Your Anderson care team.   \n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Julianne Marquez in 2 weeks for a check-in and to discuss any changes to your treatment plan as needed, or sooner if you experience any worsening of symptoms."}
