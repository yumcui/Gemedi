right hip fracture
 

 
Hospital Course:
You were admitted to the orthopedic surgery service after you 
had a right hip fracture. You had a ORIF of your right hip fracture 
and tolerated the procedure well. You are now ready for discharge.

Please follow up with your primary care physician and continue 
to take all medications as prescribed.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Right hip fracture

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker 
or cane).

 
Discharge Instructions:
- Please return to the emergency department or notify your 
physician if you experience any of the following: severe pain 
not relieved by medication, increased swelling, decreased 
sensation, difficulty with movement, fevers greater than 101.5, 
chills, increasing redness or drainage from the incision site, 
chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerns.

- You may shower, but no tub baths or swimming for at least 4 
weeks. Any stitches or staples that need to be removed will be 
taken out by the visiting nurse in approximately 2 weeks.

- Please DO NOT drive until cleared by your surgeon.

- You may resume your regular diet and increase your fluid and 
fiber intake as tolerated.

- We recommend that you avoid heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, 
or carrying items greater than 5 pounds for 6 weeks. This will aid 
in the healing process of your hip fracture.

- Please call your physician's office to schedule or confirm 
your follow",good,"1. Contradictory Medication Instructions: The patient is discharged on Enoxaparin Sodium 40 mg Subcutaneous DAILY, which is an anticoagulant (blood thinner) prescribed for DVT prophylaxis post-orthopedic surgery. However, the discharge instructions explicitly state: ""You will need to stop taking any blood thinning medication such as Plavix or Coumadin."" This creates a dangerous contradiction, as the patient might interpret ""any blood thinning medication"" to include the newly prescribed Enoxaparin, leading to a potentially life-threatening risk of DVT/PE if discontinued. The instruction should clarify which specific blood thinners (e.g., pre-existing ones held for surgery) are to be stopped, or provide clear guidance on the duration of Enoxaparin. 
2. Conflicting Follow-up Instructions: The note contains conflicting follow-up guidance. One section advises: ""Please schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel in 1 week to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as necessary."" This is appropriate for post-operative orthopedic care. However, the 'Hospital Course' section states: ""Please follow up with your primary care physician and continue to take all medications as prescribed."" While PCP follow-up is generally important, it is not the immediate priority for post-surgical orthopedic recovery, and this instruction can cause confusion or misdirection regarding the most critical follow-up. 
3. Truncated Discharge Instruction: The final bullet point under the second 'Discharge Instructions' section is incomplete: ""- Please call your physician's office to schedule or confirm your follow"". This instruction is cut off and lacks the full context."

Please resume taking all of your medications as prescribed at 
home.
 
Followup Instructions:
Return to see Dr. Julianne Marquez in 1 week for a follow-up appointment to assess progress and adjust treatment plan as needed. If symptoms worsen or new concerns arise before then, please contact our office to schedule an urgent visit with Dr. Julianne Marquez.",good,"1. **Inappropriate Medications for Age and Stated Condition:** The patient is an 11-year-old admitted for ""elevated blood sugar."" Prescribing Lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor typically for hypertension, heart failure, or kidney disease) and Simvastatin (a statin for hyperlipidemia) to a child of this age without any stated indication or history of these chronic adult-onset conditions is highly unusual and clinically illogical. The note provides no context or justification for these medications. Similarly, Omeprazole, Docusate Sodium, and Senna lack a stated clinical indication in the provided context for an 11-year-old. 
2. **Inconsistent and Misleading Diabetes Management Instructions:** The discharge instructions highlight, ""We started you on metformin which is a medication that helps lower the blood sugars,"" making it sound like a primary or significant treatment. However, the discharge medication list includes a complex insulin regimen (Glargine and NPH), which is typically the cornerstone of diabetes management, especially for new-onset hyperglycemia in a pediatric patient (suggesting Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus). The complete omission of insulin therapy from the discharge instructions is a significant clinical error, providing incomplete and potentially misleading patient education regarding their critical medications.
3. **Redundant/Overly Complex Insulin Regimen:** Prescribing both Glargine (a long-acting basal insulin) and NPH (an intermediate-acting insulin that also provides basal coverage) simultaneously as basal insulin for a newly admitted pediatric patient with ""elevated blood sugar"" is an unusual and potentially redundant regimen. This approach carries an increased risk of hypoglycemia and is typically avoided in favor of a single basal insulin, unless there is a very specific and complex clinical justification not provided in the note.
4. **Contradictory Medication Instructions:** The instruction, ""Please resume taking all of your medications as prescribed at home,"" directly contradicts the statement ""We started you on metformin"" and the implied newness of many other significant medications (insulin, Lisinopril, Simvastatin, etc.). This creates confusion regarding which medications are new prescriptions versus existing home medications, which is crucial for patient understanding and adherence.
5. **Acetaminophen Dosage:** While not an absolute error without knowing the patient's weight, 650 mg of acetaminophen for an 11-year-old is on the higher end for a single dose. Pediatric dosing is typically weight-based (10-15 mg/kg per dose), and 650 mg could exceed appropriate single-dose limits for a smaller child, increasing the risk of adverse effects."

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Vasquez,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay. You were admitted to the gynecology service after delivering a healthy baby girl at 39 weeks gestation with a postpartum hemorrhage secondary to placenta accreta. A cesarean section was performed and you required multiple units of blood for transfusion. You were seen by interventional radiology who placed an embolization in your uterus to stop the bleeding. Your condition has improved significantly since then.

Please follow-up with your primary care physician as well as 
the gynecologists listed below:

Gutierrez
 
Followup Instructions:
Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel in 1-2 weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as needed for postpartum hemorrhage management. Please contact our office to schedule this appointment at least 24 hours prior to ensure availability. During this visit, you will have the opportunity to discuss any concerns or questions you may have with Dr. Julianne Patel directly. If symptoms worsen before then, please do not hesitate to reach out to our office for immediate attention.",good,"1. Factual Inconsistency/Clinical Logic Issue: The 'Service' listed at the top of the note is 'OBSTETRICS', which is appropriate for a patient who has just delivered and experienced postpartum hemorrhage. However, the 'Discharge Instructions' section states, 'You were admitted to the gynecology service'. This is a direct contradiction and a clinical logic error, as postpartum care, especially following delivery complications like hemorrhage, falls under obstetrics, not gynecology."

Followup Instructions:
Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Marquez in 1-2 weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as needed based on patient response to current medications. Please notify her office if any worsening symptoms or concerns arise prior to the scheduled visit.",Name first letter not capitalized; date is in the future,"1. Medication dosage error/inconsistency: The medication entry for Amoxicillin-Clavulanate lists 'Potter mg PO BID', which is not a valid dosage format. While the detailed prescription below it provides a specific dose, the initial line contains a clear error. 2. Inappropriate medication for age/indication: Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg PO DAILY is prescribed for a 17-year-old patient admitted for 'cough and shortness of breath' without any stated cardiovascular indication (e.g., hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmia). This is a significant clinical logic error. 3. Inappropriate medication for age/indication and polypharmacy: Ciprofloxacin HCl 500 mg PO Q12H is prescribed for a 17-year-old. Fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin are generally avoided in pediatric patients due to potential adverse effects on cartilage, unless there is a compelling indication (e.g., specific resistant infections, cystic fibrosis exacerbation) not mentioned in this general 'cough and shortness of breath' context. Prescribing it concurrently with Amoxicillin-Clavulanate for this presentation is excessive and represents inappropriate polypharmacy and poor antimicrobial stewardship. 4. Hospital name inconsistency: The discharge instructions advise the patient to call 'the clinic at Briarwood Community Hospital' for questions, but the note is signed by 'Your Oakdale Medical Center Team', indicating a factual inconsistency in the hospital name."

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the orthopedic service for your right distal tibia fracture. You underwent ORIF with a plate and screws, which went well. You are now ready for discharge home.

* Increasing swelling
* Decreasing sensation
* Decreasing circulation
* Pain or headache with inability to tolerate your pain

During this visit, Dr. Julianne Marquez will also provide guidance on rehabilitation exercises to help with the healing process.",good,"1. Medication Redundancy/Potential for Confusion: The discharge medications include both Acetaminophen 325 mg PO Q6H PRN for 'Mild Pain' and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen (5mg-325mg) 1 TAB PO Q4H PRN for 'pain'. This creates a redundant acetaminophen regimen and increases the risk of accidental acetaminophen overdose due to multiple sources, even if the theoretical maximum daily dose is within limits if strictly followed. It is generally better clinical practice to simplify acetaminophen sources (e.g., prescribe plain acetaminophen 650 mg PRN for mild/moderate pain and a non-acetaminophen opioid for severe pain, or provide explicit instructions on how to combine the two while strictly tracking total daily acetaminophen intake). 2. Incomplete Follow-up Instructions: For a right distal tibia fracture status post ORIF, a 2-week follow-up appointment would almost certainly include obtaining X-rays of the operative extremity to assess fracture alignment, hardware position, and early healing. The discharge instructions mention assessing 'progress' and 'suture removal' but omit explicit mention of X-rays, which is a critical component of orthopedic fracture follow-up."

Dear Mr. Blackwood,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Northbrook Community Hospital.  You were admitted to the 
hospital after a fall with right hip dislocation and left shoulder 
dislocation. You underwent reduction of your right hip dislocation 
in the emergency department, and your left shoulder dislocation was 
reduced by orthopedics on Jones. Your pain has been managed with 
oral medications, and you have not had any fevers or increased red 
cell counts in your urine. 

Because you are having difficulty walking independently, we are 
discharging you to a rehab facility where you will receive physical 
therapy to help you regain your strength and independence. You will 
also be followed closely by the orthopedic surgeons after discharge 
from rehab.

We wish you all the best!

Sincerely,
Your Northbrook Community Hospital Team
 
Followup Instructions:
Return to see Dr. Julianne Marquez in 1 week for a follow-up appointment to assess your progress and adjust treatment as needed, or sooner if you experience any worsening of symptoms or side effects from medication. Please call our office to schedule this appointment at least 24 hours in advance. If you are unable to keep this appointment, please notify us immediately so that we can reschedule for a later date.",good,"1. **Contradictory Discharge Disposition:** The 'Discharge Disposition' is listed as 'Extended Care,' while the 'Facility' is listed as 'Home Health Services.' These two dispositions are mutually exclusive. 'Extended Care' implies a stay in a skilled nursing facility or rehabilitation center, whereas 'Home Health Services' implies the patient is returning home with services provided there. The discharge instructions further state, 'we are discharging you to a rehab facility,' reinforcing the contradiction with 'Home Health Services.'
2. **Vague Medical Terminology:** The phrase 'your left shoulder dislocation was reduced by orthopedics on Jones' is unclear and non-standard. 'Jones' is not a recognizable medical location, date, or team identifier in this context. It appears to be a typo or placeholder that makes the statement ambiguous.
3. **Illogical Follow-up Plan:** The patient is being discharged to a rehab facility and will be followed by orthopedic surgeons after discharge from rehab. Scheduling a follow-up with the attending physician (Dr. Julianne Marquez) in 1 week is clinically illogical and impractical. While in a rehab facility, the patient's medical care is primarily managed by the rehab team, and specialized follow-ups (like orthopedics) would be arranged after completion of the rehab stay or as needed by the rehab facility's physicians. An immediate 1-week follow-up with the original attending physician is not typically warranted or logistically feasible in this scenario."

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Marquez,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization at Oakwood Community Hospital.  You were admitted for palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest pain.  We found that you had an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.  This is a common condition in the elderly with risk factors like high blood pressure and diabetes.

We started you on a medication called metoprolol succinate to slow your heart rate down.  Your symptoms improved significantly after starting this medication.  We also gave you some medications for nausea, vomiting, and chest pain.  You will need to follow up with your cardiologist and primary care doctor after discharge.

Please take all of your medications as prescribed.  Please stop taking the following medications:

2. **Missing Anticoagulation for Atrial Fibrillation**: Atrial fibrillation is listed as a primary diagnosis for an elderly patient (84 years old), yet no anticoagulation medication (e.g., warfarin, DOAC) is included in the discharge medication list. This is a significant clinical omission for stroke prevention unless a strong contraindication exists, which is not documented.
3. **Missing Medications for Chronic Conditions**: Despite being listed as discharge diagnoses, no medications are prescribed for Diabetes Mellitus type II or Hyperlipidemia (e.g., statin). Additionally, no specific medication for anemia (other than Cyanocobalamin for B12 deficiency) is listed, despite anemia being a secondary diagnosis and often requiring targeted treatment.
4. **Contradiction in Medication Changes**: The instruction 'Please stop taking the following medications: No changes at this time' is contradictory if the patient was previously on medications for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or anticoagulation. The absence of these medications from the discharge list implies significant changes have occurred, not 'no changes at this time'.
5. **Discrepancy in Discharge Disposition**: The 'Discharge Disposition: Extended Care' typically refers to discharge to a skilled nursing facility or long-term care hospital. However, the 'Facility: Home Care Partners' suggests home health services, which usually corresponds to a disposition of 'Home with Home Health'. These two terms represent different post-acute care settings and are inconsistent.
6. **Incomplete Follow-up Plan**: While the general discharge instructions mention following up with a cardiologist and primary care doctor, the detailed 'Followup Instructions' section only specifies follow-up with Dr. Julianne Patel (the attending physician). For a patient with new Atrial Fibrillation and multiple chronic conditions, explicit and detailed follow-up instructions for cardiology and primary care are crucial and missing from this section.
7. **Inconsistency in Inpatient vs. Discharge Medications**: The discharge instructions state, 'We also gave you some medications for nausea, vomiting, and chest pain', but no specific medications for nausea or vomiting are included in the discharge medication list. While Acetaminophen is listed for pain, the absence of nausea/vomiting medications may confuse the patient if they expect to continue them post-discharge."

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Ryder,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Mountainbrook Regional Hospital.  You were admitted to the hospital with chest pain, shortness of breath and nausea/vomiting. Your EKG showed evidence of a heart attack. A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed that your left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was 90% blocked by a blood clot. This was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The LAD artery was opened up and a stent placed to keep it open. You were monitored overnight and remained stable.

You will need to follow up with your primary care physician and cardiologist as listed below. We have made an appointment for you on Brown at 2:00 pm with Dr. Julianne Patel. Please attend this appointment so that we can assess whether or not you are ready to be discharged home safely.

Please continue taking all of your medications as prescribed, unless otherwise instructed by your physician.
 
Followup Instructions:
Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel in 1-2 weeks to monitor progress and adjust treatment plan as needed based on laboratory results and clinical assessment. Please notify her office if you experience any worsening symptoms or concerns prior to the scheduled visit. During this time, continue to take all medications as prescribed and attend any additional appointments specified by Dr. Julianne Patel's team. If your condition improves significantly before the scheduled follow-up, contact Dr. Julianne Patel's office for guidance on whether an earlier appointment is necessary.",good,"1. Missing Medication: A P2Y12 inhibitor (e.g., clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel) is a critical component of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for a patient who has undergone PCI for Acute Coronary Syndrome, but none is listed in the discharge medications. 2. Inappropriate Medication: Warfarin is prescribed without an explicit indication (such as atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valve, or VTE) for a patient post-PCI for ACS. Standard therapy involves DAPT, and adding Warfarin would constitute triple therapy, which carries a high bleeding risk and is reserved for specific, high-risk situations not described here. 3. Unjustified Medication: Cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg IM/SC DAILY is prescribed without any listed diagnosis of B12 deficiency or clinical context to justify its use, especially at this frequency for discharge. 4. Incomplete/Suboptimal Medication Order: The instruction 'Insulin SC Sliding Scale using REG Insulin' is incomplete as it lacks specific parameters (e.g., a table outlining doses for specific blood glucose ranges). Additionally, using Regular insulin for a sliding scale when Humalog (a rapid-acting insulin) is prescribed for mealtime boluses is generally not optimal clinical practice; rapid-acting insulins are typically preferred for sliding scales for better glycemic control. 5. Clinical Logic Error in Discharge Instructions: The statement 'Please attend this appointment so that we can assess whether or not you are ready to be discharged home safely' is logically inconsistent. The patient is already being discharged, so the follow-up appointment cannot be for assessing discharge readiness. 6. Factual Inconsistency in Discharge Instructions: The follow-up appointment date is listed as 'Brown', which is not a valid date."

Dear Ms. Jensen,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Eastwood Medical Center.  You were admitted for chest pain, 
and we found that your arteries were narrowed in multiple places.  
You will need to follow up with Dr. Julianne McCormick Cardiology and 
Dr. Julianne McCormick Primary Care for further management.

We made the following changes to your medications:

Please call our office to schedule this appointment at least 24 hours prior to ensure availability. If you are unable to keep this scheduled appointment, please notify us immediately so we can reschedule for a later date. Thank you! 
-Your Cardiology Team",good,"1. Incomplete Medication Changes: The 'Discharge Instructions' section explicitly states 'We made the following changes to your medications: - Started Aspirin 81 mg daily - Started Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg daily'. However, the 'Discharge Medications' list includes Atorvastatin, Clopidogrel, and Furosemide, which are all significant medications for the discharge diagnoses of Coronary Artery Disease and Hypertension. It is highly likely that Atorvastatin and Clopidogrel would also have been initiated or significantly adjusted during an admission for chest pain and narrowed arteries, yet they are not mentioned as 'started' or 'changed' in the instructions, making the list of changes incomplete and potentially misleading. 2. Inconsistent Follow-up Provider: The 'Discharge Instructions' direct the patient to follow up with 'Dr. Julianne McCormick Cardiology and Dr. Julianne McCormick Primary Care'. It is clinically unusual and illogical for the same individual to be designated as both the specialist (Cardiology) and the primary care provider for post-discharge follow-up. This suggests an error in specifying distinct follow-up providers."

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Stovall,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization at Lakeview Community Hospital.  You were admitted to the hospital after a cardiac catheterization procedure, which showed multiple blockages in the coronary arteries of your heart. These blockages were treated with stents, and you tolerated this well without complications.

You should follow up with Dr. Julianne Patel in two weeks for re-evaluation of your cardiac function and medication management.

Please continue to take all medications as prescribed by your physicians.
 
Followup Instructions:
Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel in 2 weeks to review progress and adjust treatment plan as needed. Please contact our office to schedule this appointment at least 24 hours in advance. If you experience any worsening symptoms or concerns before then, do not hesitate to reach out to us for immediate attention. We are committed to providing ongoing care and support throughout your recovery process.",good,"1. Clinical Logic Error in Admission Event: The statement ""You were admitted to the hospital after a cardiac catheterization procedure, which showed multiple blockages in the coronary arteries of your heart. These blockages were treated with stents..."" creates a logical inconsistency. If the patient was admitted *after* a cardiac catheterization, it implies the catheterization was an outpatient procedure. However, the subsequent phrase ""These blockages were treated with stents"" implies the stenting (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, PCI) occurred *during this hospitalization*. This sequence is poorly described. Typically, a patient is admitted *for* a cardiac catheterization and subsequent PCI, or admitted *for* a planned PCI after a *previously performed outpatient* cardiac catheterization. The current phrasing is ambiguous and does not clearly state the timeline of events relative to the admission. 2. Logistical Error in Follow-up Instructions: The instruction ""Please contact our office to schedule this appointment at least 24 hours in advance"" is nonsensical in the context of scheduling an initial follow-up appointment two weeks out. This phraseology ('24 hours in advance') is typically used for notifying about cancellations or rescheduling an existing appointment, not for scheduling a new one. It should ideally state to schedule as soon as possible, or provide a deadline for scheduling, or if it refers to rescheduling, it should be clarified as such."

If you experience any worsening symptoms or concerns before then, contact Dr. Julianne Patel's office immediately for further guidance.",good,"1. **Inappropriate Addressing:** The discharge instructions are addressed to ""Dear Mr. Marquez,"" which is unsuitable for a 9-year-old male patient named Jenson. Discharge instructions for a pediatric patient should be directed to the parents or guardians. 
2. **Acetaminophen Dosing (Pediatric):** The prescribed dose of Acetaminophen (two 325 mg tablets, totaling 650 mg, every 6 hours) is generally high for a 9-year-old child without a specified weight. Pediatric acetaminophen dosing is typically weight-based (10-15 mg/kg/dose), and 650 mg could exceed safe limits depending on the child's weight and total daily dose. 
3. **Docusate Sodium Dosing (Pediatric):** The prescribed dose of Docusate Sodium (100 mg capsule orally twice a day, totaling 200 mg/day) exceeds the typical recommended daily dose for a 9-year-old child, which is usually in the range of 50-150 mg per day. 
4. **Oxycodone Dosing (Pediatric & Clinical Indication):** The prescribed dose of Oxycodone (two 5 mg tablets, totaling 10 mg, every 4 hours as needed) is dangerously high and clinically inappropriate for a 9-year-old child, especially given the diagnosis of a minor head injury with no bleeding or damage and resolved symptoms. Pediatric opioid dosing is strictly weight-based (e.g., 0.05-0.15 mg/kg/dose for oxycodone), and 10 mg carries a significant risk of respiratory depression and other severe adverse effects in this age group. 
5. **Oxycodone Quantity:** Dispensing 100 tablets of Oxycodone is an excessively large and inappropriate quantity for a minor injury in a pediatric patient, raising serious safety concerns regarding potential overdose, misuse, or diversion. 
6. **Unnecessary Workup:** The note mentions an EKG and chest x-ray were performed and were normal. For a simple head injury where a CT scan was negative and symptoms resolved with rest, performing an EKG and chest x-ray is generally an atypical and often unnecessary workup unless there were other specific clinical indications or associated trauma. 
7. **Inconsistent Follow-up Instructions:** The ""Discharge Instructions"" state to follow up with Dr. Julianne Patel in ""2 weeks,"" while the distinct ""Followup Instructions"" section specifies scheduling an appointment in ""1 week."" These timelines are contradictory."

We will also provide you with a contact number for after-hours emergencies during your follow-up visit.",good,"1. Docusate Sodium Dosage Error: The prescribed dose of Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL liquid at ""One (1) ML PO BID"" translates to 10 mg per dose, or 20 mg per day. This is a significantly sub-therapeutic dose for an adult stool softener, as typical adult doses range from 50 mg to 300 mg per day. It is highly unlikely to be effective. 2. Docusate Sodium Dispensed Quantity Inconsistency: Given the very low dose of 1 ML BID (2 mL/day), the dispensed quantity of 250 ML would last for 125 days. This is an unusually long supply for a discharge medication, especially when combined with a sub-therapeutic dose and zero refills. It suggests a potential error in either the prescribed dose, the calculated dispensed quantity, or the intended duration of treatment. 3. Clinical Logic Error in Emergency Contact Provision: The instruction ""We will also provide you with a contact number for after-hours emergencies during your follow-up visit"" is a safety concern. Emergency contact information, especially for after-hours, should be provided at the time of discharge, not deferred to a follow-up appointment. If an emergency arises before the follow-up visit, the patient would lack critical information for contacting the healthcare team directly."

Prescribing two separate, potent PRN opioids concurrently for discharge pain management is medically inappropriate and creates a significant risk for medication errors, patient confusion, and potential overdose. Standard practice involves choosing one opioid or providing a clear tapering/conversion plan. 2. **Vague Discharge Diagnosis:** 'Abdominal Pain' is a symptom, not a sufficiently specific diagnosis for discharge after a hospitalization, especially given that a CT scan was performed and found no 'concerning abnormality.' A more precise diagnosis, even if non-specific (e.g., 'Non-specific abdominal pain,' 'Abdominal pain of unknown etiology,' or a functional diagnosis if appropriate), would be expected following a hospital admission for evaluation."

Inappropriate medication: Prescribing Aspirin 325 mg PO DAILY for a patient discharged after a Right frontotemporal Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) is a significant clinical error. Antiplatelet agents like aspirin are generally contraindicated in the acute and subacute phase post-ICH due to a substantially increased risk of rebleeding, especially at a high dose like 325mg. Antiplatelet therapy is typically held for a period after ICH, and its reintroduction, even at lower doses for secondary prevention, requires careful risk-benefit analysis by a specialist, usually not immediately post-discharge for a recent bleed."

Discharge Diagnosis:
Right hip osteoarthritis

 
Hospital Course:
The patient came to the hospital with right hip pain and was found 
to have a dislocated hip.  He had an emergent reduction of his 
hip, which was successful.  Post-operatively he has been tolerating 
a regular diet and has not had any fevers or chills.  His pain has 
been controlled with oral medications.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you dislocated your hip 
on the operating room table after surgery for your right hip osteoarthritis. 
You had a procedure called an emergent closed reduction, where we 
reduced your hip under sedation and it went back into place.  You 
have been tolerating a regular diet post-operatively and have not 
had any fevers or chills.  Your pain has been controlled with oral 
medications.
.
ACTIVITY:
- Do not bear weight on your right lower extremity
- Use crutches to ambulate
- Keep your right knee bent at about 90 degrees when sitting in a 
chair or on the edge of bed
 
WOUND CARE:
- You may shower but no tub baths or swimming for at least 4 weeks
- No dressing is needed if wound continues to be non-draining
- Any stitches or staples that need to be removed will be taken out 
at your 2-week follow up appointment

MEDICATIONS:
- Resume all home medications, EXCEPT take fewer narcotics because 
you are not able to bear weight on your right lower extremity.
- You may also take your pain medication every 3-4 hours as needed 
for pain
- Do NOT drink alcohol or drive a motor vehicle while taking any 
narcotic pain medication
 
FOLLOW UP:
Please return to see Dr. Julianne Patel in 1 week for suture removal and wound check, and again in 2 weeks for re-evaluation of your hip osteoarthritis treatment plan. During this time, please contact our office if you experience any increase in pain or swelling.

 
Followup Instructions:
Return to see Dr. Julianne Patel in 4 weeks for a follow-up appointment to assess the progress of your right hip osteoarthritis treatment and make any necessary adjustments to your care plan. Please call our office to schedule this appointment at least 24 hours in advance. If you experience any increase in pain or swelling before then, contact us immediately so that we can provide further guidance and support. Thank you for entrusting Dr. Julianne Patel with your orthopedic care!",good,"1. **Major Factual Inconsistency/Timeline Error:** The Hospital Course states the patient ""came to the hospital with right hip pain and was found to have a dislocated hip,"" implying the dislocation occurred *before* admission. Conversely, the Discharge Instructions state, ""You were admitted to the hospital because you dislocated your hip on the operating room table after surgery for your right hip osteoarthritis,"" which implies the dislocation happened *during* the hospital stay, post-operatively. These two statements are mutually exclusive and represent a critical factual error. 
2. **Missing/Ambiguous Primary Diagnosis and Intervention:** The Discharge Diagnosis is ""Right hip osteoarthritis."" However, the hospital course and discharge instructions strongly suggest a Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) was performed (evidenced by hip precautions like 90-degree flexion limit, non-weight bearing, and need for suture removal/wound check). The note only mentions an ""emergent closed reduction"" and never explicitly states a THA occurred. If a THA was performed, it is a critical omission from the hospital course and diagnosis. If only a closed reduction of a native hip occurred, then many of the post-operative instructions are inappropriate. 
3. **Inconsistent Activity Restrictions/Hip Precautions:** The activity restrictions ""Do not bear weight on your right lower extremity"" and ""Keep your right knee bent at about 90 degrees when sitting"" are classic hip precautions typically given after a Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA), particularly a posterior approach, to prevent dislocation. These are generally not standard for a simple closed reduction of a native hip dislocation without associated fracture or other complications, which are not mentioned. This reinforces the likely omission of a THA. 
4. **Inconsistent Wound Care Instructions:** The instruction ""Any stitches or staples that need to be removed will be taken out at your 2-week follow up appointment"" implies a surgical incision was made. This contradicts the sole described intervention of an ""emergent closed reduction,"" which is a non-incisional procedure. This again points to an unmentioned surgical procedure like THA. 
5. **Clinical Logic Error in Medication Instructions (Narcotics):** The instruction ""Resume all home medications, EXCEPT take fewer narcotics because you are not able to bear weight on your right lower extremity"" is clinically unsound. Being non-weight bearing (especially if painful or difficult) usually requires *adequate* pain control, not necessarily *fewer* narcotics. This instruction is confusing and contradictory regarding pain management. 
6. **Minor Medication Dosing Inconsistency:** The prescribed OxyCODONE is ordered ""Q4H:PRN Pain - Moderate,"" but the discharge instruction states, ""You may also take your pain medication every 3-4 hours as needed for pain."" This is a minor inconsistency in the dosing interval. 
7. **Conflicting Follow-up Schedules:** The note provides two different sets of follow-up instructions. The ""Follow Up"" section mentions appointments at 1 week (for suture removal/wound check) and 2 weeks (for re-evaluation). The subsequent ""Followup Instructions"" section states, ""Return to see Dr. Julianne Patel in 4 weeks for a follow-up appointment."" This creates confusion regarding the exact timing and number of required follow-up appointments. 
8. **Insufficient Oxycodone Supply:** The prescription for Oxycodone 5 mg tablets, Disp #35, taken every 4 hours PRN, provides a maximum of approximately 5.8 days of medication (35 tablets * 4 hours/tablet / 24 hours/day). Given the patient's condition (recent hip reduction, non-weight bearing, ongoing osteoarthritis pain) and the follow-up schedule (1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks), this supply is likely insufficient to cover the period until the first or subsequent follow-up, potentially leading to uncontrolled pain or early refill requests."

Clinical logic issue: The discharge diagnosis is ""Right knee osteoarthritis,"" and the note mentions ""splint/dressing"" and ""incision,"" strongly implying a surgical intervention, most commonly a Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). For an uncomplicated TKA, immediate weight-bearing as tolerated (WBAT) without a brace is the standard rehabilitation protocol. The physical therapy instruction to ""bear weight on your right lower extremity with your brace in place"" is inconsistent with typical post-uncomplicated TKA rehabilitation and lacks context if a specific complex scenario or alternative procedure necessitating a brace was performed."

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Jensen,

You were admitted to the hospital after you experienced a stroke. You 
were found to have a blood clot in your brain which was causing some 
of the damage seen on imaging. The neurology team felt that this 
stroke was most likely due to a combination of factors including 
your high cholesterol, diabetes and smoking history.

You were treated with medications to thin out your blood (Plavix) 
and to prevent you from having another stroke. You will continue 
to take these medications at home as well as your other 
medications for high cholesterol and blood pressure control.

The physical therapists worked with you while you were in the 
hospital and felt that you had made sufficient progress so that 
you are safe to go home. They recommended that you wear compression 
stockings on your legs when walking or standing for long periods 
of time. The occupational therapists also worked with you and 
felt that you have the skills necessary to take care of yourself at 
home.

The neurologists felt that it is safe for you to return home as well 
and that you do not need further inpatient rehabilitation at this 
time. They recommended that you follow up with your primary care 
physician within the next week and schedule an appointment with a 
neurologist in two weeks for re-evaluation of your stroke.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your Ramirez Medical Center Team
 
Followup Instructions:
Please return to see Dr. Julianne Marquez in 2 weeks for a follow-up appointment to assess progress and adjust treatment plan as needed. During this time, please continue to take all medications as prescribed and report any changes in symptoms or condition to the office immediately. If you experience a worsening of symptoms or have concerns before your scheduled follow-up, contact Dr. Julianne Marquez's office for urgent attention.",good,"1. **Medication Duplication - Statins:** The patient is discharged on two different statins concurrently: Simvastatin 40 mg PO QPM and Atorvastatin 20 mg PO QPM. Prescribing two statins simultaneously for cholesterol management is redundant, increases the risk of adverse effects (e.g., myopathy, liver damage), and is not standard clinical practice. 
2. **Medication Duplication - Beta-blockers:** The patient is discharged on two different forms of Metoprolol: Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg PO DAILY and Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg PO DAILY. Prescribing both an extended-release and an immediate-release formulation of the same drug concurrently is highly unusual, potentially confusing for the patient, and can lead to dosing errors or adverse effects. 
3. **Medication Duplication - Loop Diuretics:** The patient is discharged on two different loop diuretics: Torsemide 20 mg PO BID and Furosemide 40 mg PO BID. Prescribing two distinct loop diuretics at the same time is typically unwarranted and significantly increases the risk of dehydration, electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hypokalemia, hyponatremia), and renal dysfunction. 
4. **Inconsistency in Discharge Instructions vs. Medications (Plavix):** The discharge instructions explicitly state: ""You were treated with medications to thin out your blood (Plavix) and to prevent you from having another stroke."" However, Plavix (clopidogrel) is not listed among the discharge medications. This is a significant discrepancy as the patient is instructed about a medication they are not being discharged on. 
5. **Missing Diabetes Management:** The discharge instructions state that ""diabetes"" was a contributing factor to the stroke. However, there are no medications listed in the discharge medication section for the management of diabetes (e.g., oral hypoglycemics, insulin). This is a critical omission given the identified risk factor. 
6. **Warfarin Dispensing Quantity Error:** The prescription for Warfarin is 6 mg PO DAILY, but the dispensing quantity is specified as ""Disp #*30 Tablet Refills:*0"". Taking 6 tablets (assuming 1mg strength as per RX instruction 1mg 6 tablet(s)) daily means 30 tablets would only last for 5 days (30 tablets / 6 tablets/day). This is an insufficient supply for a discharge medication intended for ongoing use, especially with zero refills. 
7. **Unexplained Gout Medications:** The patient is discharged on Allopurinol 300 mg PO DAILY and Colchicine 0.6 mg PO DAILY, which are medications for gout. However, there is no mention of gout, hyperuricemia, or any related condition in the discharge diagnosis or contributing factors listed in the note, making the rationale for these prescriptions unclear within the provided context."

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Reyes, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Eastwood Medical Center.  
You were admitted to the pediatric medicine service with 
fever and abdominal pain. You had an ultrasound of your abdomen 
which showed that there was no fluid in your abdomen or signs of 
infection.

We started you on antibiotics for possible infection of your 
appendix, but the ultrasound did not show evidence that your 
appendix is infected. We will continue you on these antibiotics 
for 7 more days to be sure that your symptoms are due to a 
non-infectious cause and not an infection of your appendix.

We also started you on medications for nausea and pain control.  
You should take the pain medication every 6 hours as needed, but 
do not take it closer than 4 hours apart.
Please follow up with your primary care physician (PCP) in 
Barnes within one week of discharge from the hospital to ensure 
that there is no evidence of infection or other complications.

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Eastwood Medical Center.  

Sincerely, 

Your Eastwood Medical Center Team
