Clark have \nrecovered from this procedure well and Gonzalez are now ready to \nreturn home. Samples from your colon were taken and this tissue \nhas been sent to the pathology department for analysis. Mitchell will \nreceive these pathology results at your follow-up appointment. \nIf there is an urgent need for the surgeon to contact Patel \nregarding these results they will contact Mejia before this time. \nLambert have tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is \ncontrolled with pain medications by mouth. Nelson may return home \nto finish your recovery.\n\nIf Moore have any of the following symptoms please call the office \nfor advice Wilson:\nfever greater than 101.5\nincreasing abdominal distension\nincreasing abdominal pain\nnausea/vomiting\ninability to tolerate food or liquids\nprolonged loose stool\nextended constipation\ninability to urinate\n\nIncisions:\nMullen have small laparascopic incision sites with steri-strips in \nplace. Those will eventually fall off on their own. This is \nhealing well however it is important that Southbrook Community Hospital. monitor these \nareas for signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing \nredness of the incision lines, white/green/yellow/malodorous \ndrainage, increased pain at the incision, increased warmth of \nthe skin at the incision, or swelling of the area.\nCastro may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. \nThe small incisions may be left open to the air. If closed with \nsteri-strips (little white adhesive strips), these will fall off \nover time, please do not remove them. Please no baths or \nswimming until cleared by the surgical team.\n\nIt is expected that Southbrook Community Hospital. may still have pain after surgery and \nthis pain will gradually improved over the course of your stay \nhere. Garcia will especially have pain when changing positions and \nwith movement. Daniels should continue to take 2 Extra Strength \nTylenol (Dunn) for pain every 8 hours around the clock and Nelson \nmay also take Advil (Ibuprofen) 600mg every hours for 7 days. \nPlease do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 hours or \nany other medications that contain Tylenol such as cold \nmedication. Do not drink alcohol while or Tylenol. Please take \nAdvil with food. If these medications are not controlling your \npain to a point where Harding can ambulate and preform minor tasks, \nBrock should take a dose of the narcotic pain medication \noxycodone. Please take this only if needed for pain. Do not take \nwith any other sedating medications or alcohol. Do not drive a \ncar if taking narcotic pain medications.\n\nAndrews may feel weak or \"washed out\" for up to 6 weeks after \nsurgery. No heavy lifting greater than a gallon of milk for 3 \nweeks. Jackson may climb stairs. Collins may go outside and walk, but \navoid traveling long distances until Mcclain speak with your \nsurgical team at your first follow-up visit. Your surgical team \nwill clear Fernandez for heavier exercise and activity as the observe \nyour progress at your follow-up appointment. Williams should only \ndrive a car on your own if Johnson are off narcotic pain medications \nand feel as if your reaction time is back to normal so Berger can \nreact appropriately while driving.\n\nWilliams have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a \nnew ileostomy placement is dehydration. The output from the \nstoma is stool from the small intestine and the water content is \nvery high. The stool is no longer passing through the large \nintestine which is where the water from the stool is reabsorbed \ninto the body and the stool becomes formed. Reyes must measure \nyour ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output from \nthe stoma should not be more than 1500cc or less than 500cc. If \nMiller find that your output has become too much or too little, \nplease call the office for advice. The office nurse or nurse \npractitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the \nileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if Myers notice \nyour ileostomy output increasing, take in more electrolyte drink \nsuch as Gatorade. Please monitor yourself for signs and symptoms \nof dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon standing), \nweakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue. If Bush notice these \nsymptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room \nfor evaluation if these symptoms are severe. Vance may eat a \nregular diet with your new ileostomy. However it is a good idea \nto avoid fatty or spicy foods and follow diet suggestions made \nto Soto by the ostomy nurses.\n\nVaughn monitor the appearance of the ostomy and stoma and care \nfor it as instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. Griffin stoma \n(intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be \nbeefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times \nwhen touched and this should subside with time. The skin around \nthe ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the \nskin around the stoma for bulging or signs of infection listed \nabove. Please care for the ostomy as Kelly have been instructed by \nthe wound/ostomy nurses. Cook will be able to make an appointment \nwith the ostomy nurse in the clinic 7 days after surgery. Gonzalez \nwill have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks \nhelping to monitor your ostomy until Chang are comfortable caring \nfor it on your own.\n\nThank Lamb for allowing us to participate in your care! Our hope \nis that Southbrook Community Hospital. will have a quick return to your life and usual \nactivities. Good luck!\n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nReturn to Dr. Julianne Marquez in 2 weeks for a post-operative check-up and re-evaluation of your condition following surgery, as recommended by your surgical team.
