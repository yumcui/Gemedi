your leg which showed you have a stress fracture in your tibia.

Limit your activities to those mentioned below in the activity 
section. These are general guidelines and may need to be adjusted 
according to how you are feeling on a particular day.

getting better call the office. You can also take over the counter 
medications such as Tylenol or Motrin for minor discomfort if 
allowed by your doctor.

get the incision wet.
You may eat a regular diet.

If you have any questions or concerns that are not answered in this

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Wellesley,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission to 
Fulton Community Hospital.  You were admitted with headache, 
nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbance.  Your symptoms were 
likely due to migraine headaches.  We started you on IV fluids 
and pain medication without improvement in your headache.  You 
were evaluated by neurology who felt that your headache was most 
consistent with a migraine headache.  We also performed an MRI of 
your brain which showed no evidence of stroke or other acute 
process.

We made the following changes to your medications:
- Started Aspirin 81mg daily
- Started Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg daily

Please continue to take all of your home medications as 
prescribed.  Please DO NOT restart any blood pressure or heart 
medications until you see your primary care doctor in the next 
few weeks.  We are not sure what dose is appropriate for you at 
this time.

Please follow up with neurology on an outpatient basis within 4 
weeks.  Please also schedule a follow-up appointment with your 
primary care physician within the next few weeks to discuss 
restarting some of your blood pressure and heart medications.

Thank you again for allowing us to participate in your care.
-Your Fletcher Community Hospital Team 
 
Followup Instructions:
Return to see Dr. Julianne Patel in 2 weeks for re-evaluation of migraine headache symptoms and to assess response to current treatment plan. If symptoms worsen or new concerns arise before then, please contact our office to schedule an urgent appointment with Dr. Julianne Patel.","The patient was started on Aspirin 81mg daily and Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg daily during admission, but the note instructs the patient to not restart any blood pressure or heart medications until they see their primary care doctor in the next few weeks, which seems to be a contradictory instruction."

Dear Mr. Rylan, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your recent hospitalization. You were admitted to the hospital with a seizure and underwent an MRI of your brain which showed no abnormalities. We believe that this may be related to viral gastroenteritis that you had in the weeks prior to admission. 

Because you have not been able to tolerate oral medications for 
your migraines, we are starting you on a medication called Aspirin 
which is taken daily. Please continue taking your other home 
medications as directed.

In addition, please follow-up with Neurology and Primary Care 
Physician (PCP) as listed below.

Dear Ms. Brown,  

It was a pleasure taking care of you at Smith!  

You were admitted with headaches and nausea, but your brain 
imaging did not show any signs of stroke.  You had an MRI which 
showed some inflammation in the lining around your blood vessels 
in your brain, so we would like to repeat this imaging on an 
outpatient basis. 

We also think that you have a viral illness which is causing 
your headaches and nausea.  We recommend that you continue taking 
ibuprofen for pain relief if needed.  

Please follow-up with Dr. Julianne Patel as scheduled!

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. Ryder,

You were admitted to the hospital after a CT scan of your head 
showed evidence of a stroke in the left side of your brain. A 
stroke is when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted 
or reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients.  The 
most common cause of stroke is a clot that forms elsewhere in the 
body and travels to the brain (a thromboembolic stroke).  

You had a MRI scan of your head which showed evidence of a small 
infarct in the left hemisphere of your brain, consistent with an 
ischemic stroke.  You were seen by our neurology team who felt 
that you would be safe to go home with close follow-up.

Please return to the ED if you have any new onset of weakness or 
numbness on one side of your body, difficulty speaking, slurring of 
words, facial drooping, loss of sensation in your extremities, 
difficulty finding words when speaking or understanding others 
when speaking, dizziness, vertigo, headache, ringing in the ears, 
tinnitus, hearing loss, double vision, blurred vision, nausea and 
vomiting, fevers greater than 101.4, chills, sweats, palpitations, 
shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain or any other 
symptoms that you are concerned about.

Please follow up with your primary care physician at your next 
scheduled appointment.

Dear Mr. Smith,

You were admitted to the hospital after you experienced a 
stroke in your brainstem on Moore, and then developed some 
confusion afterwards. We found that there was a small area of 
damage in your brainstem, which is an important part of your 
brain that helps with many different functions including 
movement, sensation, and breathing. 

During your hospitalization you were treated with medications to 
prevent future strokes and to prevent seizures. You also worked 
with physical therapists to improve your balance and gait.

You will be discharged home with the following changes:
1.  Please continue taking all of your medications as prescribed 
2.  Please follow up with your primary care doctor in one week 
3.  Please make an appointment with a neurologist within two 
weeks, who can assess you for further management and follow up on 
your brainstem stroke
4.  You will also need to see a speech therapist after discharge 
to help improve your communication after the stroke.

Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you 
experience any of the following symptoms:
1.  Difficulty speaking, understanding others, reading, writing, 
or paying attention.
2.  Slurred speech
3.  Weakness in the left side of the body

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Morales,

You were admitted to the neurology service for evaluation of new 
numbness in your left arm. You underwent an MRI of your spine, 
which showed a disc herniation at T1, causing compression of the 
nerves exiting this level on both sides. This is likely responsible 
for the numbness you have been experiencing in your left arm.

We did not perform any surgical intervention for this issue. You 
will be discharged home with a plan to follow-up with Dr. Julianne Patel as an outpatient.

Please continue taking all of your medications as prescribed and 
follow up with your primary care physician at your earliest 
convenience.
