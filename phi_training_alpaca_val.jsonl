We also stopped the warfarin \nto bring your level back to normal which helped stop the \nbleeding. We also started a medication Clark pantoprazole which \ndecreases the acid in your stomach which may also help stop \nbleeding. You will need to restart the warfarin Gonzalez \nNicholson.

You \nhad fluid in your lungs, which may have contributed to the \nshortness of breath.  This fluid in your lungs may have been due \nto a heart attack, heart failure, a blood clot in your lungs, or \na combination of these issues.  It is very likely that you had a \nblood clot in your lungs, but we did not do the CT test to \nconfirm this, given that it would likely further harm your \nkidneys.  We also did not treat you for this blood clot, given \nthat the treatment would increase your risk of having blood in \nyour urine and increase the risk of you dying from a bleed in \nyour gastrointestinal tract or head, especially if you were to \nfall.  Your family agreed with this plan.\n\nWe gave you Lasix (a diuretic) to decrease the fluid around your \nlungs.  After we did this, your breathing improved.  \n\nFor your heart, we gave you aspirin (an increased dose compared \nto what you used to take), metoprolol (a beta-blocker, which \ndecreases the work that your heart has does when pumping blood), \nand atorvastatin (which decreases cholesterol plaque formation \nin your arteries).  \n\nYou also had blood in your urine, which may have been coming \nfrom your prostate or your bladder.  We transfused you with red \nblood cells in order to increase your red blood cell level.  The \nbleeding stabilized.  Please follow up with urology at the \nappointment time listed below.\n\nThank you for allowing us to take part in your care.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Julie Skinner in 3 weeks for a re-evaluation of your primary condition and to assess progress towards recovery. If you experience any worsening symptoms or concerns before then, do not hesitate to contact Dr. Julie Skinner's office to schedule an earlier appointment."}

In \nthe hospital you were treated with intravenous fluids out of \nconcern that you may have been dehydrated. Your sodium and \ncortisol levels were low, which taken together with the rest of \nyour history, suggests a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. The \nadrenal glands secrete hormones that regulate the body's salt \nand water balance, as well as make us feel energized. We think \nthat your adrenal glands may have become inflamed. We do not \nknow why this happens, although it is more common in young \nCaucasian women. We will treat you with a short course of \nsteroids, a class of medication that reduces inflammation. Also, \nwe noticed that your thyroid stimulating hormone level was high, \nalthough your thyroid hormone level itself was \nborderline/normal. This finding should be rechecked at \noutpatient follow up. \n\nPlease follow up with your primary care doctor at the \nappointment listed below.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nFollow up with Dr. Avery Wellesley in 4 weeks to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed, and contact her office if you experience any worsening of symptoms or side effects between now and then."}

Take this \nopportunity and incorporate what you have learned from your \nhealth care team.  Continue being active on a regular basis and \nfollow these healthful guidelines (not diet!) for life long \nbenefits.\n\nIn the hospital, you will be on a stage 3 diet for healing.  \nThis diet includes all liquid, high protein, low sugar and low \nfat supplements.  When you are discharged home, you may advance \nyour diet as tolerated.  Below are some helpful tips to continue \nyour journey of eating well and healthy living.\n\n \n\n1.Keep an eye on calories.\n\n2.Always eat at a table.  Avoid eating while driving, standing, \nsitting on the sofa, or lying in bed.  \n\n3.Eat slowly.  Continue to take 30 minutes to eat a meal and \nchew your foods thoroughly. \n\n4.Surround yourself with healthy foods. Clean out your cabinets \nof any trigger or unsafe foods.\n\n5.Keep a food journal or track your intake on-line.  Record \nwhat you eat, portion sizes, and the time you eat.  You may want \nto include your mood and hunger level, as well.\n\n6.Avoid skipping meals.  Always eat at regular times to avoid \novereating later in the day.\n\n7.Listen to your body.  Eat when you are physically hungry and \nstop when you are full.\n\n8.Be active.  Engage in at least Hartman minutes of physical \nactivity most (if not all) days of the week. \n\n9.Regularly check your weight.  Give yourself an acceptable \nrange (i.e. 5 pounds).  This prevents slip ups from becoming \nbigger problems down the road.\n\n10. Make small changes.  Set small, reasonable goals to keep on \ntrack. \n\n11. Reward yourself.  Treat yourself when you reach goals with \na non-food treat (i.e. pedicure, movie). \n\n12. Ask for support. Call the Diaz nutrition clinic for \nfollow-up at Bayshore Community Hospital.  Join Weight Watchers, talk to friends \nand family or contact a local dietitian. \n\n13. Drink plenty of fluids. Stay hydrated.\n\nFluids & Diet\nFluid intake is extremely important the first month of your \nrecovery. You must also take in enough liquids\nto prevent dehydration. Dehydration can cause nausea, fatigue, \nlightheadedness and dark urine.  We recommend you track what you \ndrink and eat each day. \nMost Frequent Problems\n\nDiscomfort\nAbdominal soreness below your ribs on the left side is the most \ncommon site of tenderness after waking up. Despite this \ndiscomfort, it is very important that you get out of bed and \ntake short walks.\n\nDehydration\nYour most important job after surgery is drinking enough fluid. \nDehydration is the most common reason to return to the hospital \nafter surgery. Your goal is to drink 8 cups (64 oz) of fluid a \nday. You may not be able to drink this much fluid at first, but \ncome as close as you can. Refer to your nutrition\npacket for more details.\n\nWound Drainage & Infection\nIt is important to care for your incisions to prevent infection. \nYou will have small fiber tapes on your wounds. This should keep \nyour wound dry and closed. Leave them on until they fall off by \nthemselves. Do not put band aids, ointments, lotions or powder \non your incisions. You may get your incisions wet but\navoid scrubbing them. Pat them dry. It is not unusual for an \nincision to drain a little bloody fluid after you\ngo home. If you have some drainage, dab the wounds with diluted \nhydrogen peroxide (hydrogen\nperoxide mixed half and half with water) and then cover with a \ndry gauze. Doing this twice a day will\nspeed your recovery.\nInfections are uncommon and rarely serious after a laparoscopic \noperation. An infection will be red, warm,\nfirm, and tender. The infected fluid will look more like pus \nthan like blood. If you notice this please call the\nnurse at the Bariatric Frederick Program to discuss your symptoms.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\nSchedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Mark Ramirez in 4-6 weeks to re-evaluate the treatment of dysphagia and assess progress towards recovery. During this visit, you will also have the opportunity to discuss any ongoing concerns or symptoms with Dr. Mark Ramirez."}
